Grew up in the French court
Oui oui bonjour
Life was a chore
So
She set sail
1522 came straight to the UK
All the British dudes lame
Epic fail!
Ooh
I wanna dance and sing
Politics
Not my thing
Ooh
But then I met the king
And soon my daddy said
"You should try and get ahead!"
He wanted me, obviously
Kept messaging me like every day
Couldn't be better then he sent me a letter
And who am I kidding
I was prêt à manger
Ooh
Sent a reply
Ooh
Just saying ’Hi'
Ooh
'You’re a nice guy
I'll think about it maybe
XO baby'
Uh oh
Here we go
You sent him
kisses?!
I didn't know I would move in with his missus
What?!
Get a life!
You were living with his wife?
Like, what was I meant to do?
Sorry, not sorry 'bout what I said
I'm just trying to have some fun
Don't worry, don't worry
Don’t lose your head
I didn’t mean to hurt anyone
LOL
Say 'Oh, well!’
Or go to hell!
I'm sorry, not sorry 'bout what I said
Don't lose your head
Three in the bed
And the little one said
"If you wanna be wed
Make up your mind!"
Her or me, chum
Don’t wanna be some
Girl in a threesome
Are you blind?
Ooh
Don't be bitter
Ooh
'Cause I'm fitter
Ooh
Why hasn't it hit her?
He doesn't wanna bang you
Somebody hang you
Uh oh
Here we go
Your comment went viral
I didn't really mean it
But rumours spiral
Wow Anne, way to make the country hate you!
Mate, what was I meant to do?
Sorry, not sorry about what I said
I'm just trying to have some fun
Don't worry, don't worry
Don't lose your head
I didn't mean to hurt anyone
LOL
Say 'Oh, well!'
Or go to hell!
I'm sorry, not sorry 'bout what I said
Don't lose your head
Tried to elope
But the Pope said 'Nope!'
Our only hope was Henry
He got a promotion
Caused a commotion
Set in motion the C of E
The rules
Were so outdated
Us two wanted to get
X-rated
Soon
Excommunicated
Everybody chill
It's totes God's will
Henry's out every night on the town
Just sleeping around like "What the hell?"
If that's how it's gonna be
Maybe I'll flirt with a guy or three
Just to make him jel
Henry finds out and he goes mental
He screams and shouts like
So judgemental!
You damned witch
Mate, just shut up!
I wouldn't be such a b...
If you could get it up
Uh oh
Here we go
Is that what you said?
And now he's going 'round like
"Off with her head!"
No!
Yeah, I'm pretty sure he means it
Seems it
What was I meant to do?
What was she meant to do?
Like, what was I meant to do?
What was she meant to do?
No, but what was I meant to do?
Sorry, not sorry about what I said
I'm just trying to have some fun
Don't worry, don't worry
Don't lose your head
I didn't mean to hurt anyone
LOL
Say 'Oh, well!'
Or go to hell!
Just go to hell!
Sorry, not sorry about what I said
Sorry, not sorry about what she said
Sorry, not sorry about what I said
Don't lose your headAll you wanna do
All you wanna do, baby
I think we can all agree I'm the ten amongst these threes
All you wanna do
All you wanna do, baby
And ever since I was a child, I'd make the boys go wild
All you wanna do
All you wanna do, baby
Take my first music teacher, Henry Manox
I was young, it's true
But even then, I knew
The only thing you wanna do is... mwah
Broad, dark, sexy Manox
Taught me all about dynamics
He was twenty-three
And I was thirteen, going on thirty
We spent hours strumming the lute
Striking the chords and blowing the flute
He plucked my strings all the way to G
Went from major to minor,
C to D
Tell me what you need
What you want, you don't need to plead
'Cause I feel the chemistry
Like I get you and you get me
And maybe this is it
He just cares so much, it feels legit
We have a connection
I think this guy is different
'Cause, all you wanna do
All you wanna do, baby
Is touch me, love me, can't get enough, see
All you wanna do
All you wanna do, baby
Is please me, squeeze me,
birds and the bees me
Run your fingers through my hair
Tell me I'm the fairest of the fair
Playtime's over
The only thing you wanna do is... mwah
But then there was another guy: Francis Dereham
Serious, stern and slow
Gets what he wants and he won't take no
Passion in all that he touches
The sexy secretary to the dowager duchess
Helped him in his office, had a duty to fulfill
He even let me use his favourite quill
Spilled ink all over the parchment
My wrist was so tired
Still, I came back the next day as he required
You see, I'm all you need
All you want, you don't need to plead
'Cause I feel the chemistry
Like I get you and you get me
And I know this is it
He just cares so much, this one's legit
We have a real connection
I'm sure this time is different
'Cause, all you wanna do
All you wanna do, baby
Is touch me, love me, can't get enough, see
All you wanna do
All you wanna do, baby
Is please me, squeeze me,
birds and the bees me
You can't wait a second more
To get my corset on the floor
Playtime's over
The only thing you wanna do is... mwah
Yeah, that didn't work out
So I decided to have a break from boys
And you'll never guess who I met!
Tall, large, Henry VIII
Supreme head of the Church of England
Globally revered
Although you wouldn't know it from the look of that beard
Made me a lady-in-waiting, hurled
Me and my family up in the world
Gave me duties in court and he swears it's true
That, without me, he doesn't know what he'd do
You see, I'm all you need
All you want, we both agree
This is the place for me
I'm finally where I'm meant to be
Then he starts saying all this stuff
He cares so much, he calls me "Love"
He says we have this connection
I guess it's not so different
'Cause, all you wanna do
All you wanna do, baby
Is touch me, love me, can't get enough, see
All you wanna do
All you wanna do, baby
Is seize me, squeeze me,
birds and the bees me
There's no time for when or how
'Cause you've just got to have me now
Playtime's over
The only thing you wanna do is... mwah
So we got married . . . woo!
With Henry, it isn't easy
His temper's short and his mates are sleazy
Except for this one courtier
He's a really nice guy, just so sincere
The royal life isn't what I planned
But Thomas is there to lend a helping hand
So sweet, makes sure that I'm okay
And we hang out loads when the King's away
This guy, finally
Is what I want, the friend I need
Just mates, no chemistry
I get him and he gets me
And there's nothing more to it
He just cares so much, he's devoted
He says we have a connection
I thought this time was different
Why did I think he'd be different?
But it's never, ever different
'Cause, all you wanna do
All you wanna do, baby
Is touch me, when will enough be enough, see?
All you wanna do
All you wanna do, baby
Is squeeze me, don't care if you don't please me
Bite my lip and pull my hair
As you tell me I'm the fairest of the fair
Playtime's over
Playtime's over
Playtime's over
The only thing, the only thing...
The only thing you wanna do is... mwahDivorced
Beheaded
Died
Divorced
Beheaded
Survived
And tonight,
we are...
Live
!
Listen up, let me tell you a story
A story that you think you've heard before
We know you know our names
And our fame and our faces
Know all about the glories
And the disgraces
I'm done 'cause all this time
I've been just one word in a stupid rhyme
So I picked up a pen and a microphone
History's about to get overthrown
Divorced
Beheaded
Died
Divorced
Beheaded
Survived
But just for you tonight
We're divorced, beheaded live
Welcome to the show, to the historemix
Switching up the flow as we add the prefix
Everybody knows that we used to be six wives
Raising up the roof till we hit the ceiling
Get ready for the truth that we'll be revealing
Everybody knows that we used to be six wives
But now we're ex-wives
All you ever hear and read about
Is our ex and the way it ended
But a pair doesn't beat a royal flush
You're gonna find out how we got unfriended
Tonight we gonna do ourselves justice
'Cause we're taking you to court
Every Tudor Rose
has its thorns
And you're gonna hear 'em live in consort
Divorced
Beheaded
Died
Divorced
Beheaded
Survived
But just for you tonight
We're divorced, beheaded live
Welcome to the show, to the historemix
Switching up the flow as we add the prefix
Everybody knows that we used to be six wives
Dancing to the beat till the break of day, once
We're done, we'll start again like it's the Renaissance
Everybody knows that we used to be six wives
But now we're ex-wives
Divorced
My name is Catherine of Aragon
Was married twenty-four years,
I'm a paragon
Of royalty, my loyalty is to the Vatican
So if you try to dump me
You won't try that again
Beheaded
I'm that Boleyn girl
And I'm up next, see
I broke England from the Church
Yeah, I'm that sexy
Why did I lose my head?
Well my sleeves may be green
But my lipstick's red
Died
Jane Seymour, the only one he truly loved
Rude
When my son was newly born,
I died
But I'm not what I
seem, or
am I?
Stick around and you'll
suddenly see more
Divorced
Ich bin Anna of Cleves
Ja
When he saw my portrait he was like—
Jaa
But I didn't look as good as I did in my pic
Funny how we all discuss that
But never Henry's little—
Prick up your ears,
I'm the Katherine
Who lost her head
Beheaded
For my promiscuity outside of wed
Lock up your husbands, lock up your sons
K. Howard is here and the fun's begun
Survived
Five down, I'm the final wife
I saw him to the end of his life
I'm the survivor, Catherine Parr
I bet you wanna know how I got this far
I said, I bet you wanna know how we got this far
Hey!
Do you wanna know how we got this far?
Then welcome to the show, to the
historemix
Switching up the flow as we add the prefix
Everybody knows that we used to be six wives
Get your hands up, get this party buzzing
You want a queen bee?
Well there's half a dozen
Everybody knows that we used to be six wives
But now we're ex-wives
One, two, three, four, five
SixHe got down on one knee, but I said "No way"
Packed my bags and moved into a n-n-nunnery
Joined the gospel choir
Our riffs were on fire
At the top of the charts is where I'm gonna stay
Henry sent me a poem all about my green sleeves
I changed a couple words, put it on a sick beat
The song blew their minds
Next minute I was signed
And now I'm writing lyrics for Shakesy P
Since my first son, our family's grown
We made a band and got quite well known
You could perhaps
Call us the Tudor Von Trapps
I'm just kidding
We're called the Royal-ing Stones!
We're one of a kind, no category
Too many years lost in history
We're free to take our crowning glory
For five more minutes
We're Six
What a shame, yeah, my face, it cost me the crown
So I moved to the—
Haus of Holbein!
In my hometown
His mates were super arty
But I showed them how to party
Now on my tour of Prussia,
everybody gets down
Music man tried it on
and I was like, "Bye"
So I thought, "Who needs him? I can give it a try"
I learned everything
Now all I do is sing
And I'll do that until I die
Heard all about these rockin' chicks
Loved every song and each remix
So I went out and found them
And we laid down an album
Now, I don't need your love
All I need is Six
We're one of a kind, no category
Too many years lost in history
We're free to take our crowning glory
For five more minutes
We're Six, whoa, whoa
We're Six, whoa-oh-oh
We're Six, whoa, whoa
For five more minutes
It's the end of the show, of the historemix
We switched up the flow
and we changed the prefix
Everybody knows that we used to be six wives
But we want to say before we drop the curtain
Nothing is for sure, nothing is for certain
All that we know is that we used to be six wives
But now we're one of a kind, no category
Too many years lost in
history
We're free to take our crowning glory
For five more minutes
We're one of a kind, no category
Too many years lost in history
We're free to take our crowning glory
For five more minutes
We're Six, whoa, whoa
We're Six, whoa-oh-oh
We're Six, whoa, whoa
For five, four, three, two, one more minute
We're Six
