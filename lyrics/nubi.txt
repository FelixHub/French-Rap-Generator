Hey, baby, your hips was getting big
Now you're getting thin, you don't care about your wig
Now Woolie Willie got a pair of my sneakers
Wonder where he got 'em, 'cause I hid 'em behind my speakers
The object of your affection is the treetop connection
Where basically you love to smoke your wools
The crackheads and crack men they come up to my door
I don't smoke jums, so what they knocking for?
Kids love to feel on you, feds got a seal on you, street time is limited to days
On your crack card you're getting only A's and C's for come back
Damn, it's a shame you're the mighty queen of vials
With a wide-eyed look and a rotten-tooth smile
Used to walk with a swagger, now you simply stagger
From one spot, on to the next spot, on
To the next spot on to the next
Bitch, get a job, from me you won't rob
'Cause I'll smack you with a hose filled with sand
Now give that to the crack man
You was fly once, now you're losing all your fronts
Started off light, only tipping woolie blunts
But now you get a a stripe, graduated to the pipe
Took a long pull, hype
Yeah, head crack, head crack
You smoked up that stack in a minute you was back
(
Ayo, X, wasn't that your girl?
) Yeah, I had to drop her
'Cause she caught on the plastic and I just couldn't stop her

I knew this girl named Tropicana, she's always juicing
Producing cash from her sexual tasks
She loves men that trick like Halloween and treat
You ain't paid, then your grade is incomplete
You've got to flash dollars to prove her
And when you do she sucks it up like a Hoover
Taking all your papes like inhalation of vapes
Her nasal passage is filled with money, and it's massive
What I am is what I am
Well, what you are is a stunt, man, you're on a hunt
And your plan is to take all you can from a man and scram
I've seen your kind before, you're not original
Just a sick, mixed-up individual
Giving up the crotch for a fresh gold watch
Marking off the goods you get going up another notch
Your ways and actions are like those of a savage
If the price is right, then anyone can ravage
Even Monty Hall can have himself a ball if his assets are in order
What's really scary is you're somebody's daughter
So don't come around trying to make a profit
At the expense of another man, stop it
'Cause you see, you're the freak show of the town
Know what I think you ought to do is

As the jewels jingle from the hot young and single little stunt
A forty and a blunt, that's all she really wants
But she'll spend your papes and she'll use up all your plastic
And if you swing an ep', you'd better wear a prophylactic
'Cause things are getting drastic
Slide up in the wrong one, you'll end up in a casket

Sister, there's no need in speeding
She was doing lays before she started bleedin'
What makes a bitch want to act in this fashion?
Pulled more stunts than my man Action Jackson
A real gold winner just like Bruce Jenner
Lay the bitch on the bed and then you run right in her
Puba makes no mistakes
She said, "Rock me tonight
for old time's sakes
"
Picture that (
Slow down
), you little hooker
Honey got a problem with the bends
Meaning she likes to bend over and then she spreads the skins
The ho is just a ho and that's without the controversy
She can make the bedsprings sing a song of mercy
Come on, toots, you can take a thousand douches
Scrub that ass and I'll still pass (
Slow down

You're living foul (
Slow down, slow d— slow down

Now see it ain't no reason for you to be out here skeezing
'Cause it's not the season
So if you want to live foul and be a dum-diddly-dum-dum bitch
Well, go ahead

Punks jump up to get beat down!
One day when I was ridin' on the train, I seen these two kids talkin'
About the Nubian reign had fallen
I didn't say nothin' 'cause these kids caught my goat
Even wore my coat like a
murder that they wrote
So this kid with mouth swagger 'n I'll blaze the cloak and dagger
So I gotta show Dukes the macho lot that I am
I can rock a jam, make the world drop ham
Oh yes, I'm the bad man, and bad men wear black
And if it comes to droppin' bombs, yo, I'm with that
Though I can freak, fly, flow, fuck up a faggot
Don't understand their ways, I ain't down with gays
You wanna grab the style that was made from my mom and my dad?
When I was young, I used to run with a notepad
Then time flew and somehow I knew that I was bad to the bone...
Black prodigy since the age of twen-ty
I could write a rhyme, rip it up and write a next one
Right on the spot, sign my name with a dot
Diamond D threw me some smooth shit, Bronx crowd roar
Stick up your wack jam, everybody hit the floor
Okay, it's you, Slim, the hard rock of the pack
Don't wanna kneel to the brothers, you must be holin'
Bust some shit in his chest, now his whole body's swollen
Why did I have to do it? He aaaaasked for it
His man saw it, so it don't mean shit to me
He's gone, that's how it's supposed to be...
Check it out now
I ain't goin' out, man, that short shit is dead
Have you heard what I said? If not, ask the dread
He got a cannon that's bad...
Similar to the one that I got from my own dad
Your punk ass'll be grass
quick fast like my name was Flash
When a nigga try and rob me for my cash
You thought you had a sweet vic', a nice pick
But you didn't anticipate that I might be sick
Now, who's the trick? 'Cause I'm not a ho 
I always do the fuckin', just might do the buckin'
I leave my Nikes stuck in your rectum, till you learn
Brand Nubian, yo, you gotta respect 'em
Dissect 'em, yo, our word is bond regardless
To whom or what, now do the Puma strut
And step the fuck off, before I punch you in your face
With the mothafuckin' bass!
Then you're gonna taste blood in your mouth
It's gonna flood south
To the ground, and you're gonna know I don't fuck around
So if you think you had two soft new jacks
We're gonna have top off you with a few cracks
To the jaw and you won't pop that shit no more
Explainin' to your friends why you're layin' on the floor
Did you want some more? I didn't think so
Just got whipped like a faggot in the clink, so
I suggest you take your bloody mess and find a piece of wire
Fix your broken jaw, then it's time to retire
Lord Jamar will live long
'Cause I give strong blows the heads of my foes
Dread flows, gives me power as it grows
Watch how rass-cladda you catch the speed knot
Heed not, and Hell will be your home
Lord Jamar, Sadat, as we swell your domeI hit a beat and swing a note as if my name was David Ruffin
Quick to toast an MC just like an English muffin
Don't worry about a thing because the Puba's never bluffing
I gets headaches from the wack, so then I take a Bufferin and I max
I wait until the opportune time and then I tax but should I max?
Now they say sinning is for sinners so I guess I'm not a sinner
Beginning's for beginners so I guess I'm no beginner
This is how I spark it, puts money in my pocket
When it comes to having pleasure I gets hard as a rocket
MC Grand Pu coming through all the residue
The songs remain classics dating back to the Babalu
My boys I call 'em Akh, the foes I let 'em jock
And I can think of many episodes I swung in Lincoln Park
No I'm not a phony and I got a tenderoni
Love the way she is - not too fat, not too bony
Don't drink Sanka, won't sink like a tanker
Knock the boots off a skirt in Casablanca and I thank her
Some rappers stink like Engelbert Humperdinck
Better yet Dick Cavett, I got a bad habit
Similar to the girl on She's Gotta Have It
I think with the brain and not what’s behind the zipper
I'm living kinda good similar to Jack Tripper
A landlord named Roper
did a show at the Copa
When I'm finished with this I'll be paid like Oprah
So if honey wants to act fly
I'll just play like Guy and I'm
Stick out your thumb and hitch
Cause you've been cut off like a light switch
See I'm programmed to slam, winter, summer, spring or fall
Before I do a show I get some kicks out the mall
Then I get my gear and I give Trev a call
Cause he works in the barbershop, right behind the mall
Other rappers tried to rob me but you know they got did
To put it blunt, honey I shrunk the kids
So bookers back off break North here comes the regulator
Betcha that you find none greater
On file is a style, that's why you caught a clip
My suitcases is packed and I'm going on a trip
To Mic-a-delphia I go for self and still be slamming
The school bell is ringing and I caught somebody cramming
For the test, oh yes, my study guide was thick
I cut you with my verbal, didn't hurt you just a nick
Off your face, don't play possum watch me and I'll blossom
Like a rose and get some new clothes
And a fresh fade from Rob
Jamar on the phone and now the Now Rule Mob
The come one, come all, we about to get hectic
If my crew don't get in, then the X makes a exit
To the rear, I'm outta here, don't front on my brothers
I take care of them before I take care of others
The wood bats is doomed, in the 90's it's aluminum
Step to the stage with a mic and I'm doing 'em something awful
I'm a citizen and I'm lawful
I go to Hunter in the fall, rip the policemen's ball
I got the power to make a car stall
I get some drinks from Glackens, and when the crowd slackens
I stop drinking and then I start thinking about
Days in the past when Derek X was last
But now I'm on the top, damn, news travels fast
Cause I'm like that, they can't see this
Read my book,
it contains many pieces of verses
I took the time to delete all the curses
So moms reach deep in your purses
And buy me, take me home and try me and do me well
Well, while I reign rhymes pour
You suck it up like a straw and jump on the dance floor
Cause every time I step in a jam
I make like a door and slam
But then girls try to turn my knob cause I'm a heart throb
I guess it's just a hazard that comes with the job
Cause every time I rock a rhyme that shows Jamar is intellectual
Girls want to get sexual
Well I guess I have to cope with being so dope
You want to be me, but can't see me with a telescope
You seek and search but still you can't find
You're weak and it hurts to be deaf, dumb and blind
A supreme mind will take you out of your paralysis
I grip the mic so tight I get callouses
And your analysis is that the Lord
Whips rhymes into shape with a mic cord
I do it good cause I'm a positive black man
Eating up suckers as if I was PacMan
Not a Dapper Dan fan, I stay casual
To rock like the J it comes gradual
You got to know the ledge to wise the dumb
And understand your culture of freedom
Power equally with the Gods
So you can build and born your cipher
All your life you must teach truth
Of the true and living God, not a mystery spook
And when you do that, pursue that goal
Which made the student enroll and only then you'll prosperPeace to the Gods, Peace Allah
A-yo, there go that brother Grand Puba
I heard that brother got knowledge of self
Yo, true indeed brother
Yo, let's have that brother come over and add on to the cipher
Sunshine, everybody looks for sunshine
Folks, get down in the sunshine
My life, my life, my life, my life!
A-yo, knowledge this
The attribute Hagi helper to another God
In need, He Allah God Islam
As I proceed to civilize the uncivilized
Word of wisdom to the groove from the wise 
I guess I'm like the Verbalizer for the fact I'm moving Blackwards
This Asiatic black man is a dog spelled backwards
The maker, the owner, the cream of the planet Earth
Father of civilization, God of the universe
Manifesting thoughts with my infinite styles
Making sure this travels twenty-three million miles
The other six I set the crucifix
Because the heart of the problem is this 
Preacher got my Old Earth putting money in the pan
For the rest of the week, now I'm eating out a soup can
He has a home, drives a Caddy through town
Has my Old Earth believing that he's coming from the ground 
Slain are those who fought for what was right
Slayed are those who fell victim to the pipe
A drug controlled substance, contained in a vial
Set up by the devil as he looks and he smiles
Good at the game of tricknology
But I have knowledge of myself, you're not fooling me
You see, the answer to me is black unity, unification
To help our bad situation
I wrote this on a day of Wisdom, Power
All being born to myself 
I won't diss the next brother to be paid, that's not my trade
It's just the plan that is designed by the colored man
Now our babies are born to think this is the way of us 
That's the way the devil wants it so it is no fuss 
It's just that sad old song, "Self Destruction"
To stop our reproduction
They put our Wisdom before us 
That makes it Wisdom, Knowledge 
But we need Knowledge, Wisdom to bring forth the Understanding 
Culture, Freedom 
Power, Refinement 
Equality, God, Build, Destroy, Borns our Cipher 
 No, not nowadays bro
Why Equal Self, a trader made an interpretation
Saying that we'd receive more gold for our labor in his nation
 God, Now Cipher
It's time to drop the bomb and make the devil pay the piper
 Why Equal Self
 Why Equal Self
 Why Equal Self
 Why Equal Self
Sunshine, everybody looks for sunshine
Folks, get down in the sunshine
My life, my life, my life, my life!
The solution: knowledge of self to better ourself
'Cause I know myself, that we can live much better than this
Nothing's changed, it's just another sequel
The devil's still causing trouble amongst the righteous people
Drugs in our community 
Can't even get a job 
Poisoning our babies 
Lying who is God 
Well, here's some food for thought, many fought for the sport
And the black man still comes up short?
It's time to motivate, build and elevate
Blind, deaf, and dumb, we've gotta change their mind state
So I dip dip diver, civilize a 85'er
Gotta let him know the devil's a conniver
This is the plan from the brother man
From the motherland, now it's time to take a stand
I keep striving to do my duty to awake 'em
To the universal family, I say As-salamu Alaykum
Yeah, now I'mma do like this
Nuff respects to the brother Jazzy Jay, nuff respect
Nuff respects, to my Brand Nubian brothers
Bust it, Lord Jamar, God Allah
Derek X is on the flex
Alamo is good to go
Sincere, the God is in here
So move on black man, move on
We gotta move on black man, move on
Move on black man, move on
We gotta move on black man, move on
Now before I motivate I'mma just say like this
Please, educate Allah's children, with equality
Move on black man, move on
You gotta move on black man, move onNow a lot of people think this is easy as it looks
Books and books of rhyme concepts and hooks
Session to session to get thoughts manifested
Stressin' and stressin' to hit the world with a blessin'
Lot of people often ask, "Puba how you givin' back?"
The way I give back is through the knowledge of my raps
Like a gem, for all my people caught out on a limb
Who be givin' in, caught out on a stem, who don't wanna win
"I'm feelin' you, I know you gettin' down like that
But what I'm sayin' dog is let me hold a little somethin', black
"I'll hit you back!" C'mon, dead that, that's the tenth time
I heard that—all you know is gimme I work hard for every penny
That I make—video and tape
LP and CD, if I fall, you feedin me?
No dough to spread, always keep a level head
Long as my seeds get fed, it won't go to my head, so
"Don't let it go your head, no!"
Everybody love a star when he on top
"Don't, don't let it go your head, no!"
Nobody comes around when the star starts to drop
"Don't let it go your head, no!"
Strive to help others who help themselves
"Don't let it go your head, no no no no no!"
Knowledge of self, and good health and wealth
The ladies a dame, no question but you can’t tell her that
Cuz sometimes she speed and put her hand out
Like I'm that ATM nigga, drop me off at Chase
Earring in her naval like she sexual
She royalty but her whole loyalty to smoke
Get wrecked in the kitchen like she run the cooking channel
And then hide the heat in the car door
Goddamn she’s a mother to be, I’m hoping twins
Give me a whole tribe
And be as sexy as Janet was on the cover of Vibe
She slick talk, threaten to walk
She got a girlfriend I used to tap back when, so she always worry and bitches
I tell her hold it down ma I give you high ranks
Sometimes you wild but I guess that's your style
If you lay up in my high-rise, will you stay wise?
Will I slay thighs? Open your eyes, girl
"Don't let it go your head, no!"
Don't believe those jealous-type cats
"Don't, don't let it go your head, no!"
Cause I'm the one makin' some late night cash
"Don't let it go your head, no!"
I told you girl my home is my castle
"Don't let it go your head, no no no no no!"
Understand it won't be no hassle
I heard your single on the battle of the beats
It won five nights, I bet you had the time of your life
Workin' so hard and so long to make a record
Finally to make a song people respected
Collect the dough at a show as you sip the Mo'
Now you hittin' the flow, you never hit befo'
That's a trip, how much better could it get?
Got the leather with the work check, all up in the whip
They're all legitimate, callin' it what it's really not
This is just one single you got, that's really hot
Tomorrow it could bust just like a blood clot
Leave you in the dust with your body to rot
Another party to rock, if it's you or if it's me
It doesn't matter cause it just won't stop
Don't let your gray matter pop
Cause when you release the album
If they don't cop, you gonna get dropped, so
"Don't let it go your head, no!"
Cause one single don't make you a hit
"Don't, don't let it go your head, no!"
Stay true to who you are and don't never forget
"Don't let it go your head, no!"
Keep your feet on solid ground
"Don't let it go your head, no no no no no!"
Cause what goes up, must come down, uh
"Don't let it go your head, no!"
"Don't, don't let it go your head, no!"
"Don't let it go your head, no!"
"Don't let it go your head, no no no no no!"Brand Nubian function
A junction of three, collaborating in a style that's like funk
To slap palms, swing arms, tap a soul
Cause no rock rolls down our hill
Yo black it's kinda ill, we don't roll no rocks we just fill
Heads with knowledge, pure foundation
Showing and proving through the manifestation
Of our name which is "Brand Nu"
Brand Nubian and we've come to
Make the people aware that black means first
Four hundred years we've been made to feel cursed
But now, it's our time to rule
Student of the old, teacher of the new school
My inspiration is the Five Percent Nation
As I cram, education was born
Like a thorn in your side I have sworn
Never to divide with Brand Nubian
You have to stand as a black man, Brand Nubian
From the Sudan plus I never ran
I'm from Africa, the central region
There I grew and formed a legion of a force
See me riding on a jet black horse, at any cost
Brand Nubians will rise up and be the boss and show it
All fairness if you're black and show awareness
You can rally 'round the flag
Stand tall, or don't stand at all
You're with the three and the three won't sag to the floor
Besides the picture that I'm painting I can draw
See me work nine to five on my easel
My physical is strong and my mind is cock diesel
Brand Nubian function in conjunction with the three
Brand Nubian, not on a bandwagon following a fad
Making use of the knowledge that we already had
Grand Pu, here to send the mind into a frenzy
I bet I'll swing something this summer for the Benzi
Seep into the mind the brain and activate the pelvis
Keeping the blind, deaf, dumb, and blind is Elvis
Meaning old, so behold 
Now if this falls short, I'll try harder
A wisdom to me is someone like Assata
I'd like to say peace to Bambaata
Tasah Kuma, Achmed, and Kenyatta
Brothers that'll fight for the cause
And they live in the boundaries of the righteous laws
To be exact, dominant means black
But some have a hard time trying to swallow that
Now we have some that are fake
Wearing blue eyes and green eyes, come on, gimme a break
Brand Nubian here to wake up
Take off the makeup, 'cause all it'll do is cake up
Just be real that's how I feel
Brand Nubian
Nubian, a native or inhabitant of Nubia
Nubian, A member of one of a group of African tribes that formed a powerful empire between Egypt and Ethiopia from the 6th to 14th century
Nubian, any of several languages spoken in the central and northern Sudan
And that's why we call ourselves Brand Nubian
As the midnight oil burns, our minds turn
Make a mistake and be fake and you'll burn
We're here to teach so you'd might as well learn
That the tree has the knowledge for what you yearn
Brand Nubian"Here we go!"
"Okay, everybody..."
Hey yo, Stud, bust it!
Step to the rear, Grand Pu is on arrival
Raised in the ghetto, singin' songs called survival
Runnin' 'round town givin' all the girls Puba snacks
I wouldn't try to steal a style, you just might catch a cardiac
Figured the way to get paid is to grab the mic, rehearse, ya know
Smooth as Jermaine, so honey, don't take it personal
There's no need of tryin' to diss the swinger
Baby, all you catch is two snaps up and the finger
The Babalu bad boy, a threat to the paranoid
You try to step to this? It's void!
A new hit from the Grand Man, work nights like the Sandman
Gain for awake in case I gotta stomp a head out
Bustin' is a trick that's not up my sleeve
It's possessed with finesse and it works when I breathe
Paid in the shade with a "A" as the grade
With the papes that I made from this trade
So get hip to the grip, you know where to slide the chips
If you wanna cash in on the wins
Grand Puba and I love to hit skins
["And you know what?"
"I've got a song to sing..."
"I've got a song to sing"
"Here we go!"
"I've got a song to sing..."
"I've got a song to sing"
"Here we go!"
Follow me now!
"Okay, everybody..." x4]
Yeah... bust it!
Grand Puba, the higher mystic ruler, keep a forty in the cooler
She don't know me, money grip, you better school her
Before I have to play her the foul way
And catch a quick short stay at the Holiday
Now, forecast says I won't be playin' soccer with the dreads
Ballin's my hobby, doin' wonders in the bed
From full-size to king-size to queen-size to high-rise
Even bunk beds, I know how to work the leg
If Pu ain't the answer, then you must be sick as cancer
Smooth romancer, let it ring, I'll probably answer
So come take a dip with your private dancer
Nasty, naughty, over six call me shorty
But I'm loooong, I'm like Stretch Armstrong
I go on and on and on and on...
Never in a scandal and I'm never caught schemin'
Knew Pu was dope ever since I was semen
Swimmin' in my daddy's big nuts
But now I'm scoopin' girls with the big ol' butts
Arise to respond for the Maxwell
Ask well, hell, it don't even matter
Puba ain't game for the shit chit-chatter
Puba's in town, oh shit! Let's scatter
You can hide that ass, but it just don't matter
The 90's is here, Pu is on a mash-out
Huns that I've done always seem to pass out
But hun, wake that ass up, this ain't the place to crash out
You try to play me? I have to throw that ass out
Foes and hoes, good riddance
'Cause when Puba comes out, there'll be no skiddin'
I'll slide upstairs and see Chuck at the chop shop
Tell him fade the sides, let it wolf on top
Reel and reel and soul to soul
Honey, heel to heel and toe to toe
It really doesn't make a diff', I'm not the type to riff
I might smoke a spliff but I won't sniff
And ya don't stop
Now I'mma end it like this...
I'm like Superfly Snuka, know how to hook a hooker
Caught her on looker, know where I took her?
To the short stay, around my way
And like Monie say, it was the perfect way
I caught a verse from the Christian, and it goes "Praise the Lord"
Skins lined up on a wharf for when I'm bored
I'm from Now Rule, I'm in the right mood
And if you like the way that this flows, well, that's cool
See, this is no illusion, the style is too confusin'
If you try to bite, then you're cruisin' for a bruisin'
Back up, sonny, and let me make my money
Then I'm straight, I got a date at 8
So see you brothers later, time to motivate
Yeah, now bust it...
I'd like to give a shout to my Brand Nubian brothers
Lord Jamar, God Allah...
Derrick X on the flex, and Alamo
And we gonna give a shout to the
SD50s
who pumped this
And I'mma say, yo, peace...Aiyyo Jamar I got a girl that's bad! 
But she don't understand my ways.. 
Arguin days after days after days..
Well I can dig it
See I done had some fly ones
But they try to get just that, thought I'd like to chase the cat
But I'm not a Dog, God is who you're lookin at
Couldn'ta tooken that, bullcrap, you woulda caught a jack
I told her, "Yo the first thing is when the telephone rings
It ain't really nuthin but noise"
You wanna flip and lose your poise?
Now they quick to flip, but yo honey get a grip
You gotta understand I'm a man with needs that needs fulfilling
And if you ain't with it somebody else is willing
You gotta love me, or leave me alone
You gotta love me, or leave me alone
You gotta love me or leave me alone *4X*
I got this good thing girl, it's the righteous love
Not that quick on the top, one shop hop
I'll make your knees get wet in the places I'll pet
I'll make you breathe, faster than you can believe
Within your hole I'll use my control
And the final burst, I'll hold
*reggae chat* until it comes
Backscratches added up in sums
Didn't your momma teach you bout b**** a man?
Bent my d*** so bad that I ran
Now I'll, freak of the week, or ride the quest of a yardgirl's hips
Your p**** can't see these lips
I keep my tongue in my mouth.. cause I can't see down South
Vulgar? Maybe, obscene with the purpose
Sayin, "I'ma do my own thing, bein I'm my own King..
And it's up to you to follow"
So on your Wisdom I'll shine my light
Bring forth the seed, created in the night
You gotta love me, or leave me alone
You gotta love me or leave me alone *4X*
The degree, love h**** right, get it right
Either all the above, or it ain't true love
I ain't down for a honey who don't wanna submit
Always throwin a fit, wanna talk a lot of s***
But love to get hit from behind
Gettin crazy joy from my Lazy-Boy that reclines
Seems the only time we're not in a fight..
Is when I'm layin the pipe..
You don't want me to bone another chick
Quick to claim my name and my d***
But when I tell you get off the swine and get refined
You act like you're blind and you lost your d*** mind
See I'm not the kind to let a woman run it
How my man Rick say it? _I Shouldn't Have Done It_
Is what I'd be saying if you was runnin the show
No h*, there's no gold, the G-O-D know
The time on the Sun and the Moon and the Stars
Dance to the tune of Lord Jamar
And if you're actin tone def it's your own mental death
Huh, you gotta love me, or leave me alone
You gotta love me, or leave me alone
You gotta love me or leave me alone *4X*C'mon Alamo, let's swing it
Before I get this wreck, I like to take a sec
To say this jam here is dedicated to some of my favorites
I like to dedicate this to PE
I like to dedicate this to BDP
I like to dedicate this to the X-Clan
I like to dedicate this to Heavy D
Kiss my mother bye 'fore I hit the road of stardom
Put away my rhymes, make sure the pimps got em
Just cause I'm a rapper, doesn't mean I'm not a fan
My favorite, Rakim, Big Daddy, Kool G and
LL who always
keep the girls jingling
C'mon honey dip, you can jingle on my 
When it comes to female rappers, bust it, here's a few
MC Lyte, Queen Latifah, Monie Love, and Linque
What more could I say, I wouldn't be here today
If the old school didn't pave the way
Hats off and I'll never forget
Cause if it wasn't for them, there wouldn't be no rap shit
Back to the track of the new
For short you can call me MC Grand Pu
I made this splendid cause that's what I intended
Don't try to break it cause you just can't bend it
I got a bad habit, see I live hitting skins
Well if hitting skins is wrong then forgive me for my sins
C'mon Ak, I'm straighter than 6 o'clock
So what you oughta do is flow wit the flock
My sign is the fish, yo, also loving on my disc
It's cool, I got dismiss cause I hated liverwurst
But here I am, a rapper, my best friend Pos the dapper
Tony X who I grew up wit in a jet so
Shake the motion if you got the notion
Puba rubs off on ya just like lotion
I'm not conceited, girls say that I'm attractive
They describe my love and that's being hyperactive
I'm just a brother who likes to romance a lot
Look at me as the black Sir Lancelot
That's right, your knight in shining armor
If I went to college, then my major would be drama
Or theatrics is more like my tactics
If you want the proof then lay down on the mattress
Swing wit the swinger, I can be a singer
Alamo controls the beat wit just one finger
If you wanna swing to this, you better take precaution
Alamo, when you hook it, make sure there's no distortion
Here comes the two, better known as the babuloo bad boys
Who makes much noise
Two Express, no local stops
It's time to get fat and collect our props
Kamikaze like Japs, you roll a 7 in craps
And if you think that this is booty, yo, it ain't no half
Met Lisa Simms, she bought a gear from Vin's
The knucklehead got her pregnant, now she got twins
The type of brother to stand out, always keep my hand out
To help another brother, what is taught by my mother
Good to the drip drop and I won't flip flop
Straight to the tip top in this here hip-hop
My style varies and my vocal carries
To El Segundo where I seen Q-Tip
Sipping on Colada wit this honey dip
So c'mon baby, spend the money, don't save it
Cause this jam here I dedicate to some of my favorites
Hey yo, check this out
I like to dedicate this to Chuck Chillout
I like to dedicate this to Red Alert
I like to dedicate this to De La Soul
I like to dedicate this to EPMD
I like to dedicate this to Andre
I like to dedicate this to the SD's
Shout outsYeah, we're gonna swing this one to the right
Wanna give a shout to my man Pos K
My man Big Daddy Scoob
Now Rule Mob
Check it out
Well, honey, here's a hickie, Puba's not a quickie
When it comes to skins, God damn, I'm picky
Who will be the princess to occupy the prince?
And if she's less than dope, I hope the limo's got tints
Now, honey, you see, this may sound profound
But LET ME LOVE YOU DOWN
And if I'm Uptown, I'm back downtown
All the skins I've been in, I gets no frowns
You see, doo-doo MC's really think they can outlast...
I smell gas
As a yung'un I was thefty, born as a lefty
The rhymes I drop, somethin' more than hefty
Roll like a Ranger, Puba's no stranger
For those who try to diss me - uh-oh, danger!
Used to drink the Olde E,
cool as Jeff Spicoli
When I play soccer with the dreads, I play goalie
Here steps the one that's capable of slaughterin'
For those who wanna bite, get the catalogue, start orderin'
'Cause - Puba's shit is on stock, Akh
I shape the wig like a woodblock
I like to dip, dip, dive, a Benz I'm soon to drive
I guess you can call this my nine-to-five
I send my lust to scoop skins with my skin buster
Freak the mind and butt behind and I gots the Georgia
But hang on for a sec!
You don't have to worry about the Puba gettin' wreck
'Cause to me, see, it's more than likely
And if I flow too fast, let me slow down slightly
Let's take a trip expenses paid money grip
Don't flake or flam, 'cause Puba's not HAVIN' IT
Derek X to the right
C'mon and clap your hands for Zulu Nation
C'mon and clap your hands for Zulu
C'mon and clap your hands for Zulu Nation
C'mon and clap your hands for Zulu
You see me rock a video and slam shit up on
Feels So Good
There was no doubt about it, 'cause I knew that I would
Before I kick these lyrics that I riff and I roll with
This girl done tried to cram
'Cause she was down with the OLD SCHOOL
She.. smacked me, attacked me, harassed me til I swung
But I made her see stars 'cause her bell rung
No.. I'm.. not a wife beater
No.. I'm.. not a girl cheater
I nipped this problem in the butt
With my force from the Rule and my man Ron.. Stud..
So give a shout if you know what I'm talkin' about
And if you don't, then brother, you're lost
I had a
Ross
, traded it in for a horse
It died, I made glue, it's no loss
I'm the boss at my job 'cause I hire all workers
Tired of the sob story tear jerkers
Compassion, for fashion never seen in our slums
Never sold work, never handled no jumb's
So que sera sera as the fat lady sings
But when the bell toll is the song I sing
Taken up the flights, whether Uptown or Crown Heights
I pound a bunch of you after lunch 'cause I do right
Appear from the rear with my Clan, and I'm the Cave Bear
Rip up the street on my worldwide tear
So loudly my troops, and let's form three groups
Wreck time is here, so let's get paid on free loops
Allah Jamar to the right
Peace God!  Peace God!
You're captivated by the science 'cause the lesson's mathematical
Jamar rockin' the jam, is an emphatical
Y, equal, Knowledge Born
I go on, although clothes get torn
By Weaker Cypher men
.. 'cause what came from my pen
Made 'em lust, now I must
Rush out the back door, in-to the alley
Girls in pursuit, enough to form a rally
I didn't wanna scuff up my brand new Bally's
So I made a quick dip, like I was goin back to Cali
Took the Lear jet, don't fear yet
Comin on your earset!
So as I hit program, you know I'm gonna slam
Cause even in my name there's a funky live "Jam"
Don't eat Spam or no types of ham
Polite to all women so I say, "Yes ma'am!"
Sniffin a gram ain't flam, it's kinda weak
Jamar I keep you open through the rhymes I speak
Not down with a frat, no I ain't no Greek
_A Message From a Blackman_ is what you seek!PEACE my Nubian brothers.. 
Aiyyo knowledge this, we came here to do one thing
And this is what we gonna do
We gonna drop the bomb 
We gonna drop the bomb 
We gonna drop the bomb 
We come to drop the bomb 
 We gonna drop the bomb
on the
Yakub crew
, 
 We gonna drop the bomb on the Cave-Man crew
, 
 We gonna drop the bomb on the Ignorance crew
, 
 We gonna drop the bomb
'Cause that's what we come to do
, 
Well, I build like a mason, facin' the East
And brought West, to the belly of the beast
Pro-test, because this land ain't just
I seek equality and freedom as a must
Now, if understand is understood, well, that's good
On equal planes we can bring forth change
Rise the dead from the graves of slaves
Fly the head of the men in the caves
Try instead to unify with our own plan
Why do we fear the devil now that he's a grown man?
'Cause he bought you, taught you how to eat the wrong food
But now it's time for fastin'
Life everlastin', offer thy I-self Lord and master
And all things in my circumference
Lord Jamar makes a difference
I have no tolerance for black ignorance
I keep strivin', drivin' 'cause I'm driven
By the course of Allah, the true and livin'
Cream of the planet earth, God of the universe
The first soul, black like coal
Ask how old? There's no said birth record
The devil couldn't check it even if he wants to check it
The Nubians record, all will respect it
So I think we'll go ahead with
Knowledge Knowledge

What I provide will collide with devilish ways of thinkin'
Erasin' false facts that started with Abe Lincoln
Bein' great, used his weight and freed the slaves
But did he free us?
Take a look around at the black man, see us
Illiteracy rules, they showin' cartoons in school
They're way understaffed, and I don't understand the math
Now, the way the system works
The black man can get the purchase
Drop the family, it neutralizes many
Like wards of the state, doin' one-to-ten in Dannemora
The welfare system can create a black horror
Now some people need the money but others, they can manage
By doin' this, they take away the cash for disadvantaged
And the long list grows, more dependency bodes
This creates a cycle but a cipher unequal
This is the wrong circle that contains the black people
Now the way devil got us is the way the devil want it
He try to hold us back and he overly floss it
This ain't even his land, the Indians was here first
The savagery displayed made the red-man disperse
I'm out to squash the whitewashed brainwashed line of thought
I got a million books and a school in the fort in the Rule
With three great teachers
God Sincere made it clear, is also a great feature
So beware, devil man, the days of purge is almost over
The army's on the range, you think it's kind of strange
Nubians is in the picture, Armageddon's gonna hit ya

So, here I go from the tippy, so those who wanna flow, let's go
Steppin' in stride as I move with pride
Blind, deaf and dumb, the God Haji's here to guide
Follow me now, children
For wisdom, I always seem to give a conniption
Unlike a pimp, I'm more like an Egyptian
Straight to the Kingdom is where I bring 'em
And I school 'em,
Now Rule
is where I rule 'em
He-Allah-God-Islam, now act
But let me slow down 'cause Eighty-Fives can't get with that
It's Hagi, Helpful to Another God In need
 True indeed
The devil is the one who dare not to unite us
Brought forth the plan on how to divide us
Jamaicans, Christians eatin' bacon
When I greet my brothers, I say, "Asalaam alaikum!"
So I strive to my duty for the better of the black man
Everywhere you look, the black man is on the map and
Here comes a Nubian to give a hand and feed a land
When I drop my bomb, it's headin' straight for the colored man
Known as Asiatic, confrontation causes static
Might I add, I sincerely love Allah's mathematic
So let's move on, the mental of the black man has been torn
I feel it's my Justice-Cypher-Born to keep on
I come to reach one, each one teach one
So here I come to the drum
Pull it back one time, pull it back! 
'Cause see, the purpose of me comin'
Is to give a third eye to the blind
For years, we fought
The blind's been taught to change the thought
But this time, black man, we're takin' no shorts
Can't be used as a tool, nor as a slave
Here comes the God to send the devil right back to his cave
So Uncle Tom, just be alarmed 'cause it's time to...

"Kick a little step as the Ep gets swung"
Yo, this is the stick-up boom music for styles to flow free
Did y'all know it's me or could you tell by the speed?
The Deuce Crew of the new, yeah
, makes the whole shit clear, yeah
Give the question, I'm tired of brothers guessin'
The Nubian name brought the X a lot of fame
But wouldn't it be a shame if it all up and ended?
That ain't the plan I had, shit like that ain't intended
For the slick headed wonder, wearer of saggy pants
Old school kicker, reviver of the circumstance
Got a backpack with a fat stack of fact
I got a three-oh, so P.O. step back
I'm with the uptown baldies, kids that were low once
I kick for kids that's paid, I kick for kids with no funds
Whole blocks come for classes
Kids with contacts, kids with glasses
Hard-rock punks, crack-heads and even drunks
Wanna know the truth, so they flock to my roof
New York, I got the grip - I told ya, I told ya
This means war, as said by Sister Souljah
To think that the X would ever take a fall after gettin' all of this? Man, you're crazy!
The only way I'd fall is if I got fat and lazy
And I won't 'cause I work real hard
Wake up in the mornin' at the hour of God
and make beats
Later, hit the streets for some 45th sweets
So all y'all been told, black youth essential
From the hard urban blocks of Now Rule residential
That the God rocks real hard
"Wreck time is here, so let's get paid on free loops"
"Kick a little step as the Ep gets swung"
Goddamn right, the L-O-R-D J-A-M-A-R
Says peace and Allah U Akbar
Back like a motherfuckin' head to crack
Brand Nubian tracks are filled with black facts
Now, I ain't Humpty Dumpty, chump
See, I ain't fallin', you can go callin'
All the King's horses and all the King's men
Try to knock me off, you'll never see another day again
My seven-twenty-one-fourteen's ready
And my scope with the laser beam steady
So if you're feelin' lucky, then come and catch a buck
How could I kill a man? Well, I just don't give a fuck
So check out the dreadlock, make the dead rock
With my bald head, A-alike the tongue twin
We're bound to win 'cause God don't like ugly
You get slugged, rushed, raped, robbed and mugged, G
I don't wanna be the man, I just wanna make jams
Cuttin' sharp like Edward Scissorhands
It's '92 and of course we grew seeds
They're planted like a farmer, so let's reap what we sew
And if you're thinkin' that we're a hoe in the game
We gettin' wreck to your brain 
"Wreck time is here, so let's get paid on free loops"
"Kick a little step as the Ep gets swung"C'mon, word is bond, we got it goin' on
Brand Nubian'll rock to the break of dawn
It's like that, y'all, ya don't stop
Brand Nubian'll rock the sure shot
Well, let me get a piece of the track, peace to the black
Peeps on the streets with the beats in the Jeeps, comin' back
In '94 with the raw that's against the law
It's the G-O-D, my delivery is C-O-D
Word is bond and bond is life, we got it goin' on tonight
Don't nobody wanna fight, they wanna see a tight show
Where some brothers might go for broke
Utilizin' the effects of the smoke
I pull cash to smash, make the blunt last
Fill it with hash, too and pass, don't even ask
In a flash, put that ass in the grass
Flag is half-mast, somebody must've passed
We're makin' your ass drip into the stands
Fold my cash at last, my task to teach the class
And receive somethin' more than brass and some glass
Make a brother work hard, long and fast
Dreadlock, I said I rock for my block
Clock wax like crack, samplin' from old stacks
That's where the soul's at in this whole rap universe
We kick the funky tunes with a verse
Sun, moon and star, some boom for Jamar
To get me in the flow, now I'm read' to go
Set to show everybody in the party that we nice
Without sippin' on Bacardi and ice
This style flash, Jamar'll be the shinin' star
No matter who you are, no matter who you are
I'll rape the tape, travel on the interstate
With weight, wipe the slate and mob the gate
And by fate, I'll avoid the court date, no legal aid
Everythin' is paid, why cause a tirade?
If the money ain't made, talkin' millions
But spendin' pennies and gettin' cheap shoes from Kenny's
Now, let's take time out to say peace to the Gods 
Bust how I release 'cause this beat is hard
We be the squad Fard taught to rule
Take a thought to the top, now I drop the jewel
I push the Cadillac DeVille and still be real
I drive a garbage truck and not give a ...
I need to earn a buck fo' the year
I'm through with buyin' wild gear
Just somethin' I can wear, somethin' fly when I appear
Well, now we're here to take the gold and the cash for the bill fold
I told their ass to chill and they still cold
Frozen 'cause they not amongst the chosen one
Sun shines like a beacon, similar to how I'm speakin'
As I receive the mic for the last time, I clear up your past crime
All felonies can go, as long as you know
Brand Nubian will stand without the use of a band
We always work with a planOn veut nous faire croire

Yes yes yes
It's a test test test
Now Rule is the town
WHERE WE REST REST REST
If you were wondering
Were the ballistics finally in
Once again
BRAND NUBIAN!
You and your girl came to see the three rock
NOW SHE STAYS
Kick the funky lyrics, throw her down
TO HER PJ'S
Lay her on the floor and do work
IN THREE WAYS
After the party
Guess what?
Aiyyo she's still payin!
"Feels so good!"
I caught this girl a mink sable, in return I got a cable
Her name was Fat Mabel and she broke my kitchen table
Ate pasta with this rasta, went out with his sister
Had hairs on her chin, thought she was a mister
Went out disco dancin', gave my feet a big blister
Smacked her in her face until I finally I dissed her
Encounter with a stunt, in her mouth were five fronts
And stunt was on the wiggy, I thought her name was Ziggy
But her name was Lucy and I met her on the deucey
Put me on hold to go in a store to get loosey
Aiyyo Max, you need to stop it
Now let me kick some flavor since we're building on the topic
'Cause yo, I knew this girl and her name was Tina
She rested in Medina, never saw eyes greener than hers
But yo, there was just one little flaw
The green eyes I had to penalize 'cause they was bought in a store
Synthetic cosmetic, it was pathetic
If they was real, then yo, she'd get the credit
But they wasn't, so she doesn't
I like the natural look, so I kicked it to her cousin
"Feels so good!" 
 C'mere let me put it to you like this sugar
 Don't go changing, to try to please me
 Don't change the color of your hair!
 Your hair, your hair, your hair!
 I said no no no I just want someone
 that I can talk to!
I'll take you just the way you are!
 Word is bond!
 Yeah right!
Too hot to handle when I was young I used to vandal
Givin' girls the comfort like a foot and a sandal
Always help another brother, NEVER runnin' scandals
And if I hit the skids, well I'll just PANHANDLE
Now I'm gettin' papes, but stunts gets the vapes
I see it as a joke 'cause they break when you're broke
I can give a ROAR like an ancient dinosaur 
Swing a microphone like the great mighty Thor
Puba Maxwell 'cause the Max is hyphenated
Girls seem to love the way my things are situated
Hump on a bump til them bumps feelin' sore
Take a quick breather then I'm goin' back for more!
"Feels so good!" 
 Brother, Derek X, KICK FLAVOR
I do my thing like B.B. King, my microphone is named Lucille
Throw a dip in my hip so they call me extra ill
Making big hits from tidbits, how I make my bread
Do some situps, and squat thrusts, to keep a level head
Cause I'm WELL BRED, and mannered, I create in my workshop
Stay up late at night until my brain says to stop
Then I quit, wake up in the morning and continue it
I find the same line, and add some more  that's hype
But my stripes, marks me by champ
Check out the bass coming from the power amp
I'm the controller and like the Ayatollah
I used to live in Saudi Arabia
I never come out straight out with an answer
Just a yes, or a no, or a maybe I do
But with my crew sometimes I get BLAZED
Jump on the floor and kick a new dance craze
I can read and I've read since the days of RIF
If rhymin' is fundamental, then light up a spliff
And grab, and not an ounce of flab, is on my body
My mother's part Spanish, my father's part yardie
I'm not a junior, try to see me catch a wound
I got yeast to rise straight to the moon
"Feels so good!" 
 Lord Jamar, God Allah step to it!
Girls scope this, like in astrology they knowledge me
That's cause I'm God, but don't look too hard in the sun
'Cause you might get done
My number's seven, that's SIX PLUS ONE
Now anyway, you count Lord Jamar will amount to be
A tower, so yo, knowledge my power
As I conclude, to girls I won't be rude
Just verbally feedin em my mental food
I embellish with lyrics, that can't be contested
Serve em straight from my mouth and in your ears they're digested
The rhyme I say, is out of the ordinary
Some say unique I prefer the term EXTRAORDINARY
MC's rhymes are ancient like a dinosaur fossil
They're weak and outdated while my rhymes are collosal
Like a Lamborghini, I look good, and I'm expensive
Plus the power I'm unleashing is just, too intensive
Discombublatin MC's within my vicinity
Guys like my rhymes, girls like MY MASCULINITY
When I'm on the mic I say what I feel
I'll never perpetrate cause the God's for real
It's like that  and at my jams you know you'll never be bored
So just dance and scream, praise the Lord
Alright now this is how we gonna do it
Before we get out like Shout
We used to be some soloists but now we form TRI-PACK
And if you try to step to this you just might catch an EYE JACK
And if you were intelligent, you really wouldn't TRY THAT
This is just one black, WE'LL BE BACK!
To my man Alamo
And to the man Sincere
To my man Mark the Spark
And to my brother Melachon
And Skeff Anslem on the board
Aiyyo check this out
We got some shoutouts for my man Grand Puba
YouknowhatI'msayin since he doin the "la la-lah"
He wanna say peace to his man C-T-W-O
To my man Zee I'll see you real soon!Uhh
Now it's love, vs. hate
Time for my people to eliminate
That hate, let's love
Because it's our people that we're thinking of
Now they say we playa' hatin' cause we hate the black on black
And the fact we can't stand when we act like that
Self-hate killin' us more than the po-po or crack
I tell my peoples with the gats it ain't about all that
We arrived on slave ships, tortured chained and whipped
Four hundred years of bein' slaves in the land of the brave
Have we forgotten? Our ancestors forced to pick cotton
Women raped and tortured, murdered if they caught ya
Niggas swung from trees like a breeze do summer leaves
Swayin' back and forth, failed attempts to make it North
Millions of people died just so that we can survive
So this knowledge I provide cause these facts can't be denied
Nowadays it's new ways, sixties it was the smack
Eighties it was the crack, nineties it be the gat
Time to recognize how uncivilized we got
Get wise and unify and not fall victim to the plot
Cause it's love, vs. hate
Time for my people to eliminate
That hate, let's love
Because it's our people that we're thinking of
It's love, vs. hate
It's time for my people to eliminate
That hate, let's love
Because it's our people that we thinking of
Uh, when will we make our Exodus
? When will the guns
Bust the other way instead of at the brother next to us?
That's all that they expect from us, police stand by
Don't believe the lie that they're the ones protectin' us
Projects, to see how poverty's affectin' us
Robberies, we lust objects of high quality
Or so we think we slowly sink into the quicksand
With no support, like a bike that doesn't have a kickstand
We stay in court, smoke Newport's, and fail to support
Our seeds, with no thoughts for they needs
We fought for the cheese and all it got us was a grave
Or a bid as a slave, we live in
the land of the brave
Where the home isn't free
, grown niggas be
In a zone, tryin' to act out the TV
We cracked out and greedy with a lack of respect
It's time to come correct, it's time to come correct
Cause it's love, vs. hate
Time for my people to eliminate
That hate, let's love
Because it's our people that we're thinking of
It's love, vs. hate
It's time for my people to eliminate
That hate, let's love
Because it's our people that we thinking of
Sally, been gettin' beat for years
Husband come home high off of weed and beers
He frustrated cause his job is low rate
Low money, plus his wife brother act kinda funny
My nosey neighbor always makin' it her labor
To cause controversy, I seen them out in Jersey
The teacher say my son show aggression
I tell her it's in our lesson, for him to know himself
To me the greatest wealth is the best of health
When the music stops, I'll play the role like my pops
And his pops and so on I got a legacy to go on
I'll watch out for my babies and I'll kill for 'em
And if they wanna receive the knowledge
Then I'll build for 'em
Now if it's love vs. hate, then what's your fate?
What we showin' with the money we blown?
Shit is still chaos, ain't a damn thing sewn
Cause it's love, vs. hate
Time for my people to eliminate
That hate, let's love
Because it's our people that we're thinking of
It's love, vs. hate
It's time for my people to eliminate
That hate, let's love
Because it's our people that we thinking ofWell ahh, good evening my Nubian brothers and sisters, ahh
Tonight we got a REALLY big show, ahh, really big show, ahh
Con-duc-ting his Concerto in X Minor
We have the brother, Derek X
Ahh, his theme tonight will be on racism in a New Yawrk backdrop
Brother Derek X..
Ah, yes, yes, yes, thank you, thank you, thank you and all of that
Yo, before I get this wreck, I wanna give a STRONG shout
To all the positive brothers and sisters that's out there
And I just wanna let y'all know who I came down here with
I slid in here with Lord J and Alamo with the A
And I came to get wreck, like THIS!!
I'm kinda blessed so I wrote this manifesto for life
Co-signed by the others with a knife
On the real tip, let's take a field trip from the ghetto
You pick the time and we'll meet in the meadow
To discuss racial issues and tension
New York's a powder keg, did I forget to mention?
Now, case in point, y'all remember that Brooklyn Bridge joint
When things got wild and wooly?
Yeah, that day the Feds played the role of the bully
"Up against the car!"
"Yo, I ain't even do nuttin' man"
"Aiyyo shut up or you get smacked!"
"Yo, why you pushin' me why you hittin' me man?"
Now, Huey Newton was slain
And we all felt the pain
of Yusef Hawkins
And they was mad but we was squakin'
They tried to show a false compassion
Yet, at the rally, they tried to bash in our brains
Further addin' to the bloodstains
I was mad at this news and so was my brothers
And I wanted to get violent but I'm a lover of black mothers
And black mothers need sons
Not children that's been killed by guns..
It's, just a-nother form of slavery, a modern day lynchin'
The others get the word, the black man feels the tension
Inside, not out to hide, just provides us all the answer
I will stop racial injustice if I get the chance to!
Now, the civilized man's main goal is to teach
And I try to achieve this with verbal outreach
In my community, and all outlayin' counties
Spread the message of good with my Now Rule mighty
Step up to the right, dispense and be known
Remember what I said is to teach your own
At home first, and as we disperse
I sparks your head like a cloudburst
Y'all don't stop, y'all don't quit
Derek X, I'm guaranteed to be the ultimate
 I kicks the flavor!
So bust that, I drop the stack from my almanac
It's all truth so it's got to be a shown fact
So keep on, this is the dawn of the Capricorn Turtle
A rhyme that I kick is stored daily in my journal
Or my diary, when speakin' on the black man, I gets fiery
The record's in the record store, category's black war
Best you ever saw and it comes in a three or a four pack
In a month or two, I'll be back
To confer with you on both of my works
In my contract, I get crazy perks from Elektra
See me kick this rhyme and I covered the whole spectrum
This is the final verse, grand finale in Crescendo
Message substance of the X cannot be thrown out the window
Unseen, lean two years past the teen
Never use makeup, got a natural sheen
It's like that, y'all, let's have a ball
I'm Derek X, about six feet tall
Yeah, and as I stop this wreck for one sec
I wanna give a shout to the Grand Puba
Also to Clark Kent, Marley Marl
Pete Rock from the Vernon
I wanna give a shout to Mike P in the Cherokee also in Tucson
Rich with the Cabriolet
I wanna give a shout to all the Gods in Now Rule
Melachi, Sincere and my man True Born
I wanna give a shout to Big Bob 
Scooby Real and the whole Mob from the Stallion Mark the Spark
And I'm outta here Hit her, I mean let's hit this
 That's not straight
 Do it God, ya bwoy let's do it, nawmsayin'?
Let's pull it, bwoy
Aiyyo, check this out
Brand Nubian gettin' ready to swing this ep'
We got the Grand Puba, we got Derek X on the flex
We got Lord Jamar, we got Alamo with the A, Ron Stud!
And my man Ep Rock
X, kick the flavor for me on this one
'Cause we gettin' ready to be out of here in a, sec
While New York roars, my voice-box soars
I'll, open your pores, 'cause it's one of my chores
Kickin' beats to bongo rhythms
, cuttin' rhymes to a schism
People often wonder and ask... is I'm the best?
Surely you jest, I'm not down with the rest
In fact... they failed the test
It's my vernacular that's simply spectacular
My bite is in your neck, it's the effect of Dracula
Man on a mission, go to school with low tuition
Can't even keep account of the G's I be kissin'
But oh, I beg your pardon, the race is startin'
The criminals is there and I'm the hardest of the hard
And it's a feat for you to meet me on any given day
The adjective - AMAZING, spelled with an 'A'
And a 'G' on the end, by usin' my pen
Set forth on a journey for the perfect blend
Rhymin' was a fad in the days of my dad
Now MC's is makin' G's and goin' for bad
The X in my name makes it all official
Am I the King? Well, that's the so-called issue
Rollin' off the tongue was the fresh one-liner
And CB talker was the zero one-niner
Took a slight drop from the tip of the top
Now I'm out for mines and I'm goin' to clock
What's mine on the line, on a rhyme I will dine
Never ate the pig, can't deal with the swine
Keep on, yes, my word is bond
Speakin' that knowledge like Farrakhaaaan
'Cause it's ragtime!
Ah yeah it's ragged, let's do it!
Aight now we got Lord J
Lord J, yo c'mon now
Kick, the flavor, to this
Drop it like this 
I like to drop bass, 'cause when it hits, I bounce 'em
I do this with my seven and my one half ounces of brain
Which I contain, to manifest thought
The record is bought so I figure I ought to elaborate
 as minds in turn collaborate
I speak the facts, black, I don't exaggerate
I just get to the bare essential
Demandin' that I talk of my credentials, 'cause yo
I never slept, my mind was in the right place
Now, let's take our steps and retrace back to a time
When black was defined as Original, God-like, Supreme Divine
Refined is my mind that's why I'm buildin'
There was a void in New York but now it's filled in
By the Lord J, don't forget the A-M-A-to-the-R
Now say I'm a Star 
Well, you can be one, too
Now, here's all you got to do 
You got to know Knowledge of Self's the foundation
Know wisdom's the way to let it out, cuz
Understandin' is the manifestation
And culture freedom, the final turnout, 'cause it's ragtime
That's definitely ragtime
Now let me rag mine! Let me rag mine
Hit this in the 90's
Hey yo, bust it 
As I, stand as a Pharaoh and read up on Elijah
Trick ends on my friends, 'cause Puba's not a miser
Last longer than a Duracell, or an Energizer
I got a little older but a whole lot wiser
When it comes to shootin' shots, I'm a damn good shooter
MC Grand Puba should be worshiped like a Buddha
I boogies to the rhythm, kicks all the flavortism
Damn, I gets busy, though makin' rhyme I gets bizm
Always help another, meanin' sister or a brother
Just a little tip I picked up from my mother
Smooth as Ali Baba, once I week I see the barber
So, honey, pucker up 'cause I'm a DAMN good slobber
Mr. Exquisite, dressed in silk, Bally's made of lizard
So, honey, what is it? 
I rock a rhyme at a weddin', next tour I'm probably headin'
You want a beat like this? Check the stack of Otis Redding
I'm hurtin' like a blister, confusin' like Twister
Not an only child, four brothers and one sister
Not a rinky-dinky, never snackin' on a Twinkie
When it comes to flexin', I can bend it like a Slinkie
So here comes the champ, to civilize a tramp
When brothers try to play me, that's when the Pub' gets amped
So smile - here comes the picture - click!
A humble type brother so don't play me as a vic'
I can relate to the Good Times, the Cosbys only sometimes
Go to service on a Sunday, then it's back at work on Monday
Take my gear to the cleaners, buy pants or a Beamer
Then I'm out, beggin' crackheads, I can do without
 'Cause it's ragtime
* ad libs to outro *"We are ready ladies and gentlemen.."
"It's star time!" 
"Million dollar man!"
Once again as we swing this ep' with the Grand Puba
If I seen you kick it once, I seen you slam it a thousand times
You gots ta flow with this one G
Grand Puba comin-in-a-rhyme dancehall style, see?
Hah, you thought I couldn't do dat
Dem say, who can busy like dis man?
And if dem search the whole land dem not find a man
Puba is the one to make dem fly girls have a ba-all
Wha-oh-eee!
See other-dem MC's, dem not scare me
De virgins say me can't wait to hear me
You want it done right, den give Grand Pu' a ca-all
Not let me get busy on this one..
See brothers be wishin that's why they're eager to listen
Tryin to do me but see they're no competition
Grand Puba's the type, to get hype, to any funky sound
Never the type, to give a damn about a hand-me-down
Papers of rhymes of mine are stacked high like lumber
If hon wants to swing ep', she takes my beeper number
The skills go back to the days of flippin coins
Pasttime readin books by my man Donald Goines
But I'm not a pimp, and I don't walk with a limp
You can say I know the game, cause I know how to treat a dame
So knock three times on my ceiling if you got the feeling
Grand Puba's good for sexual healing
Lord have mercy this is lovely, I'll say splendid
Puba's on the stage, and I'm glad you all attended
Rhymin to the beat, is the way I make my money
I'll buy, sweets for my sweets and, no sugar for my honey
Brothers get, played for their papes
And if a stunts tried to play me, I'll hang her like some drapes
Puba's the man, and you can't run the flam
So take it elsewhere, my dear
See others try so hard to be this
Competition tries so hard to see this
But I let em know, I'm not the one
So see the next one, wha-oh-eee! Whoa!
I'll slap five to a brother who ain't about no jive
I'll smack ten to a friend who hooked me off with skins
See I'm the type of brother and I like to have fun
She said, "69," I said, "68, and I owe you 1"
The style I kick, you will remember
And when I step to other rappers, you better yell timber
Cause they're fallin, de-meene-meene-mee
They're fallin..
Faaaalse, claat! Will ya drop now?
You know you're sizzlin! Pull it down selector!
Easy now, easy now! Start rappin now!
Pu..ba.. I love you so
Never never never gonna let you go
Once, I, get my hands on you
Pu..ba.. I love you so
Never never never gonna let you go
I hope you feel the same way too
Hey c'mon honey you know I feel the same way
But I'mma do this my way
And I'mma do like this baby
See it doesn't really matter if the place is big or small
Cause MC Grand Puba come fi rhyme dancehall!
I'm flippin the wigs of those who gig
I never renege on girls who dig
The super supreme, one of the team of three
See I'm one of the best with most finesse
I really suggest you do not mess
Or try to test the very best at this
Do you really wanna know what's next? I gotcha gotcha gotcha
Grand Puba is one of the best.. I rocked ya rocked ya rocked ya
Here I step, with the rep that's kept
In a orderly fashion, sucker MC's I'm mashin
It's only one more verse I think that really need to be said
It's that I'm bad, bad.. inna wicked in bed
La la la la-la la, whoa la la la la-la, la la
La la la la-la la it's the Grand Pu-ba
Now hit me now selector!
Who can busy like dis man?
And if dem search the whole land dem not find a man
Puba is the one to make dem fly girls have a ba-all
Wha-oh-eee!
See other-dem MC's, dem not scare me
De virgins say me can't wait to hear me
If you want it done right, then give Grand Pu' a ca-all
Not let me get busy like this..
See my man Vance Wright he get a "nuff respect"
Sincere, Pos K get a "nuff respect"
To my man Ron Stud he get a "nuff respect"
And my cousin Dr. Who he get a "nuff respect"
To my cousin Jeff Jeff he get a "nuff respect"
And all the brothers and sisters across the universe
They get a "nuff respect"
I'd like to say peace to my Brand Nubian brothers
Lord Jamar, Derek X, and Alamo with the A and L.G Two times for the drummer, 'fore I start it I say, "Hit me!"
Puba's kickin flavor, and I brought somebody with me
 Positive, the gentlemen, the rapper
Suave blase, you know dapper
 See this is not a song about friends
Because we make the ends, and then we spread the skins
 This song becomes a well known tune
And my mic's gonna bloom like a flower in June
 We kick much flavor and you know that
As smooth as the head on a Fed named Kojak
 Grip the mic til my hand get calloused
And I'll tell you like Ralph Kramden told Alice
"Bang zoom!"
 It's up up and away
 Grand Puba
 and Positive K
 Lyrics real sweet like candy
 It's just like a condom
 WE KEEP ONE HANDY!
Go Puba, go Positive 
To my adversaries, I'm not ordinary
Not the Godfather, or the Tooth Fairy
Not Jack Spade or Engelbert Humperdink
Listen to this rhyme and tell us what you think
One, two, three. Grand Puba's on the count
Rhyming gets me papes in very large amount
Brother you're wrong, if you think crime pays
Don't like gays, and take vacations off of holidays
Practice safe sex to prevent strange diseases
Wear my hat, on one night skeezers
I roll dice, but don't bet on the horses
Punks take losses and I don't reveal my sources
So umm, take the fifth if you're planning to riff
The rhymes spread like Jif to make your loose knot stiff
Kick up your feet if you're feeling kinda queasy..
Relax..  take it easy!
You're in good hands, Positive is a survivor
I make rhymes of anything, I'm like MacGyver
If I were a computer rap would be my program
Since I'm a righteous man, I don't eat ham
I wish more people was alive like me
 But Positive..
 Whattup Max?
See the vocab is lovely, girls be thinkin of me
Other rappers try to be me, competition can't see me
So hey, whaddya say, I got the flow y'all
If you don't know the time then you better check the Seiko
Or Timex, I suplex, get biz on the co-sex
Put em in a line then I ask, "Who's next?"
Grand Puba, guaranteed to make a big hit
Doin much damage on this two man skit
Trying to hold me back won't harm me
And when the gear gets too small it's for the Salvation Army
So mami, or mida, a way I say, "No one's sweeter!"
You see the style I kick is rugged, I shine like a nugget
Present tense mean you dig it, past tense mean you dug it!
So dance, to a light tune, my lit-tle doll
Da-nah-nah, da-nah-nah, da-nah-nah, dah
Rock me wit, vi-bra-tion
Give me a deep med-i-ta-tion
There is none betta than Grand Pu-ba
Baby be get it all togetha
You see the second time around I hope the label don't flake
And if they do I go to Drake and say, "Give me a break"
Like Toyota say, I say 
I bust the foots of Lionel Richie
I caught him dancing on MY ceiling!
Pass me the mic, cause I wants to blitz
I'm the best thing that came since grits
The Prince of Rap, lookin for Cinderella
If you see her...why don't you tell her
I got the shoe, in the car out back
And if she makes the fit, she's IN, LIKE, THAT
And as a matter of fact
I'm not an actor, but the main factor
Pinpointing his rhymes like a protractor
I'm intricated, complicated
Definitely musically related
Rhymes so fly never been outdated
Gots to be fly by the way I state it
Now of myself, I say I'm a big fan
Got more rhymes, than words by the Letterman
Positive K, you can say he's low key
You might know my name but now look you don't know me
I can be nice and flip like the Son of Sam
Nobody knows exactly how I am
I'm the next and everybody knows it
Open tours this year, next year I'mma close it
I've got the skills that pays the bills, now
Here's a quote from Stephanie Mills
Don't put a rush on me cause my tempo's slow
And if I don't tell you, then how would you know?No, Flagro
Uh, what!!
Yeah, Brand Nu' comin' through
Long Island, Harlem World, all out, all out
Let's talk about it
What, yeah, now put ya hands up
Uh, what, now put ya hands up
Put ya hands up
Now get ya back up off the wall
I'm better feeling than running raw
Chain gang link I need a shrink
What y'all niggas think I'ma do when I get real money
Piano keys played in series
Peace to Lil' Cease
Microphone track board, loose chord, oh Lord
Promo number one Sadat X had a grenade
And the have next day I smashed the shit Allie played
Now we delayed by ninety days
You better find me anyways
You better return to the Terrordome, ain't nobody home
Non-haters play the corner in the elevator
Crash crews smack the open palm so you don't bruise
You push a button and what happens nothing
I push one and there's a man with a gun in the doorway
I'm in 4A, I been in there all day
I had some smokes, some bitches and chicken on a slab
There's enough for everybody so y'all niggas don't grab
Come on, come on, come on, yo
So get your back up off the wall
What, I said dance, come on, come on
So put your hands up
Stop frontin' and pop somethin'
Cornball niggas stay frontin' ain't got nuthin'
Mad cause the life I lead, twice ya speed
Brown-skinned mami, that's the wife I need
Light that weed, front nigga might just bleed
Tryin' to ball with y'all but I might just flee
The second coming of Christ
I'll make you run for your life
It's like a gun up against a knife
You can never win, when we fight to the end
I'm tight with the pen
Don't be going off the head, cause they be blown off the head
And showin off the skills of the mentally dead
I do the knowledge before any words get said
Herbs get me red, hold on, Simply Red
Pimps be dead in rap, everybody's fed with that
Y'all could go ahead with that
I'm trying to show you where my head is at
Dread be the positive black
Drop the B, you get lack
See you when you get back
Lyrical three-pack, spiritual miracle
Uhh, Lord Jamar the imperial
Microphone serial killer, urban guerilla
You acting mysterious, we out to take this rap shit serious
Slap the taste out of your mouth, then break out
Come on, come on, come on, yo
So get your back up off the wall
What, I said dance, come on, come on
So put your hands up
Stop frontin' and pop somethin'
Cornball niggas stay frontin' ain't got nuthin'
Mad cause the life I lead, twice ya speed
Brown-skinned mami, that's the wife I need
Light that weed, front nigga might just bleed
Tryin' to ball with y'all but I might just flee
Now I'ma put a rush up on molasses
Breeze on through like EZ-Passes
Wiggle more asses than aerobic classes
El kabong, my people blaze them trees up like Cheech and Chong
Get that ass open like a pair of butt cheeks in thong
For sure dog, I don't mean to come off pushy
Blaze your party hot, and have it smelling like D'bussy
Spit my phlegm and drop my gem
Collect my wins and copy the Benz with the icy rims
I be dramatical, mathematical, radical thriller
The mic killa wreckin' more shit than Godzilla
Matter of fact, I'm more iller, knock your shit off the pillar
The four-wheeler touched every flava but vanilla
You know my name, my game, so shorty shake that thang
I get you open like them bald-head niggas on Rogaine
Spit my flow all the way from New Ro'
To Acapulco, white poos brown like cocoa
Flip flows def like so so
Come on, come on, come on, yo
So get your back up off the wall
What, I said dance, come on, come on
So put your hands up
Stop frontin' and pop somethin'
Cornball niggas stay frontin' ain't got nuthin'
Mad cause the life I lead, twice ya speed
Brown-skinned mami, that's the wife I need
Light that weed, front nigga might just bleed
Tryin' to ball with y'all but I might just flee Now who comin' with that hot shit?
"Once again" BRAND NUBIAN!
 Who about to rock shit?
"Once again" BRAND NUBIAN!
 Super splashy with that head knot
"Once again" BRAND NUBIAN!
 Seal it down 'cause it don't stop
"Once again" BRAND NUBIAN!
Now as I blast off with my curricula, comin' perpendicular
Watch me kill it when I spill it, top bill it, shine like acryllic
Actions manifest with the strategy of chess
Hit you with more retardedness than the seed born from incest
Since the scrotum I was that brother
Ripped a hole in my daddy's rubber
Swan dived into my mother
Left behind a thousand others
Caught one cat sittin' in the egg, tossed him out he slid down the leg
Born months later, I come ridin' down the escalator
The doctor tried to smack me but I caught him with
a
two piece
My pops said, "Son you did it right, aww man my shorty tight"
Then he passed the brother a mic and ever since my flow been tight
Come on -- you gotta be kidding me if you think Brand Nu' lost a step
And if you do go get a late pass cause you cats done overslept
Over two thousand emcees attend school at Haji Prep
Brand Nubian brothers,
A alike, B alike, plus we see/C alike
'Cause ain't nuthin' but that blazeness when these brothers touch the mic
 Now who comin' with that hot shit?
"Once again" BRAND NUBIAN!
 Who about to rock shit?
"Once again" BRAND NUBIAN!
 Super splashy with that head knot
"Once again" BRAND NUBIAN!
 Feel it now 'cause it don't stop
"Once again" BRAND NUBIAN!
 Now who comin' with that hot shit?
"Once again" BRAND NUBIAN!
 Who about to rock shit?
"Once again" BRAND NUBIAN!
 Super splashy with that head knot
"Once again" BRAND NUBIAN!
The rap legend, never pushed a Legend, gripped the mic
With my bredderns, like Kryptonite we steal your powers
Like Black Steel in the Hour of Chaos we come back
To reveal the seventh seal, the drum track's the soundtrack
For war -- hardcore righteous, the nicest
Comin' with advice that's priceless, to help the crisis
It was felt by some, you wouldn't like this
Now we got you strung like you sniffin' that white bitch
Flippin' the tongue, even at a high pitch, we run
Shit like diarrhea, we burn that ass like gonorrhea
You learn your past through the eyes of the overseer
Me, I earn my cash tellin' the truth
They wanna make a felon out of every black youth
My nigga Stick Man got the cracked tooth, steady yellin'
In the booth, we got big plans to make loot
Waitin' for the seeds we plant to take root
 Now who comin' with that hot shit?
"Once again" BRAND NUBIAN!
 Who about to rock shit?
"Once again" BRAND NUBIAN!
 Super splashy with that head knot
"Once again" BRAND NUBIAN!
 Feel it now 'cause it don't stop
"Once again" BRAND NUBIAN!
 Now who comin' with that hot shit?
"Once again" BRAND NUBIAN!
 Who about to rock shit?
"Once again" BRAND NUBIAN!
 Super splashy with that head knot
"Once again" BRAND NUBIAN!
 Feel it now 'cause it don't stop
"Once again" BRAND NUBIAN!
I'm here seven nights a week, no charge, and for
Two drink minimum, the Wild Cowboy number one
With them C-Town and Manhattan street pose
To they dancers on Thursday's for all the lost souls
Laid out in bed she offering, don't want the pussy
Fell for the hype but now I wanna stretch her
'Cause her convo is slow, there's a lot of shit she don't know
But she young and firm, she'll learn
We hit them niggas in the middle of the month, check day
And in a future life I will probably pay
But who's to say, cause I'm right here today, and death to spray
You wanna get some smoke see my man Jose
You want somethin' stronger got to wait a little longer
From the Harley Houses to the Brasley Houses
To my City Park youth throwin' rocks off the roofs
And my sons downtown, they don't give a fuck
Let the flames off from inside of the truck 
My OT pipeline will stop your lifeline
Make your wife blind and best in your lifetime [
1er couplet :
Nubi]
J'suis une main d'fer dans un gant d'métal
Ma vie est un nid d'roses, plein d'épines, sans pétales
J'arrive plus à évacuer l'stress sans bédave
Comment veux-tu que j'fasse des espèces en restant légal ?
Dur d'avoir le respect sans s'pé-ta, tu veux croquer dans mon beefsteak (
quoi ?
) tu prends des baffes, c'est risqué d'faire du business sans pétard
Et si ta clique test, laisse, t'en fais pas, t'es pas vrai toi, tu ne traînes pas sans tes gars
Ta parole ne vaut pas une rette-bar, maintenant dégage
Moi c'est Nubi sale-té (
sal'té
), j'aime quand c'est crade
La rue est une tass-pé (
tass-pé
) mais j'me jette dans ses bras
J'ai l'sang des braves dans mes veines, la rage dans mes gênes
J'suis qu'un esclave sans les chaînes, le manque d'amour m'a rendu chien, je vis en chassant les chiennes
J'les sers, les gère et puis j'trace quand j'ai kén

Refrain :

Mon cœur est froid, il pleure des larmes de glace
Mon cœur est empli de haine, l'amour n'y a pas de place
Une main d'fer dans un gant d'métal, une main d'fer dans un gant d'métal
Si j'esquisse un sourire, c'est pour cracher ma haine
Si j'ai l'fou-rire c'est juste pour cacher ma peine

2ème couplet :
Nubi]
J'ai le cœur noir comme un trou sans fond et tu t'demandes pourquoi j'suis tout l'temps fonce
Dépressif sur les bords, on l'est tous dans l'fond, répressif sont les porcs, on est sous tension
On fait des bifs sous les porches en écoutant l'son du bitume (
sisi
)
J'aime écrire la nuit pour que tu ressentes mieux ma sombritude
Mon attitude, mon état d'esprit, j'avais déjà la scarlatitude, j'avais pas 7 piges
J'observais les grands, ils m'ont dit la vie fait mal, t'as qu'à serrer les dents, encaisse comme un homme et reste élégant
Y a deux choses à ne pas perdre, c'est la tête et le temps
Y a deux choses à ne pas faire, se perdre et se vendre, réagis si on t'agresse, se taire c'est se pendre
Évite tant que tu peux de verser le sang, sinon fais c'que t'as à faire, reste ferme et ne flanche pas
J'suis coincé entre un mur et un ravin, esprit empli de pensées impures et de chagrin
Ma peau claire est contraire à la noirceur de mon âme, non j'suis pas un rappeur démoniaque
J'suis juste terriblement blessé, évidemment stressé, régulièrement pété, naturellement dressé au combat
Conçu pour résister aux chocs, bâti pour encaisser le contact

Grand Puba
;Lord Jamar]
Peace God!
Aiyyo peace
What's the science?
Elevation
You gettin ready to drop math on this?
True indeed my brother
Well it's time to start the revolution
Aight, so let's start this
See it's a positive force which guides my course
It ain't Little Bo Peep whose sheep been lost
It's the Tribe, the God Tribe of Shabazz
First on the planet Earth, but definite to be the last
If Allah stands, she'll pass
Students enroll, while Jamar teach class
Seminar I give, is for you to live
Not try to keep your mind captive
I break shackles, tear down tabernacles
Any problem in sight, Jamar tackles
Bones crackles as I start to break
The body of the snake that's fake!
Unto my people, lies and deceit
Through trickery, but, Hickory Dickory
Dock, time's run out on the clock
The shepherd is here to protect the flock
With my staff I walk through the wilderness
Build on math, and destroy all the villainous criminals
Perpetratin constant subliminal signs to brainwash the minds
Of the unknowin, kept church goin
It's time to shine light, that's why I'm Provin and Showin
That the age has come to be concious
Not unconcious, cause in your subconcious mind
You find I speak the truth, from the DJ booth
Straight to the youth, of the inner city, and the outskirts
Some may disagree, but yo hey, the truth hurts
Lord Jamar, and I'll advance in the industry
I'm makin sure you can dance to my ministry
Now dance!
..
Aiyyo come, into my laboratory
I'ma take you on a tour..
An ankh is the key and the key is knowledge
Which unlocks my lab's door..
Kemet lets you enter, heat generates from the center
Lord Jamar's an inventor
Production of black facts, put on to a black wax
I got a lot to say, set in stacks
To the Right is where I keep my fuel
The Qu'ran and 120 lessons
Am I the nicest?  Count your 12 jewels
Word is bond, cause the Gods keep testin
Why the test?  Cause I'm 'fessin this duty of the civilized
From the dumb you bring forth the wise
So they can open their eyes to their being
And finally realize it's the all-eye seeing
Black Man Supreme, knowledge machine
The Alpha and Omega, the
Arm-a-Leg-a-Leg-a-Arm-a-Head
And like jam these facts will spread
Over the thoughts of the white bread
Cause we've been misled for the longest
Time to rise up and gather our strongest
Brothers and sister, Mrs. and Misters
Heroes and She-roes, we'll take em from the zeros
We were thought to be and show em, how it ought to be
Cause it's passively, how I fought for the
Culture of my ancestry
And made it so you can dance to my ministry
So dance!
..
Aiyyo I wanna peace to the Father Allah and Justice
I wanna say peace to all the Gods and Earths
And all the positive people of the universe
I wanna say peace to the God Sincere
The God Supreme, Lakim Shabazz
And the God Jahwell from Vernon
I wanna say peace to my Nubian brothers
Maxwell, Derek X, and Alamo
Wanna say peace to my physicals, Tony D
And Lil' Terrance
I wanna say peace to my good brother Q-Tip
From A Tribe Called Quest, De La Soul
And last but not least I wanna say peace
To the grandfather Bambaataa of the mighty Zulu Nation
And I'm out y'all
Knowledge KnowledgeThe time is running out, tick-tock, like the grains of sand
Every man sharpens man, like steel sharpens steel
The threat of a war is real
Where my soldiers for the battlefield?
And as the days of the two-oh approach
I drop a seed in my girl, so I can stay in this world
And decompose the foes that jumped up under our clothes
We living on rows on top of rows and, half our stores is clothed
We still trickin out, jerkin out
Half the project workin out
They buildin underground cities
While we concerned about seein titties
With they secret, commities, and society, orders
They carryin out the slaughter
Picture your daughter on State's for a quarter
My old Uncle Sam fought in the war of Vietnam
Got caught with napalm and burned off half his fuckin arm
The government knew then about the lasting effects
And they cut off his checks
And if he wild out he'll be murdered
Or possibly herded, to the VA Hospi-tal
Where they got em under on roof
Where they can conceal the proof
You can see shit changin cat it can't stay the same
Damn I wish the government didn't have my real name
The time is running out, tick-tock, like the grains of sand
Every man sharpens man, like steel sharpens steel
The threat of a war is real
Where my soldiers for the battlefield?
The time is running out, tick-tock, like the grains of sand
Every man sharpens man, like steel sharpens steel
The threat of a war is real
Where my soldiers for the battlefield?
Time for my army to get it on, we marched upon the lawn
Out in D.C., stated our word is bond on TV
Unfold the prophecy left in the cold by democracy
This whole world is based on hypocrisy
It's evil to the roots and now we burn and loot, and shoot guns
Extort funds, kidnap another Patty Hearst
And tap her daddy's purse, anarchist, smoking cannabis
Wrapped in brown leaves, you now trapped with the town thieves
The ground breathes in the fumes of death
Clouds loom from the smoke, of the fires we set
We travel underground the sewer system, and train tunnels
We let you know that you was victims, of brain funnels
Information like computer generation, see
Proper Education Always Causes Elevation
It's time for liberation, we gonna put this plan in activation
Government assassination, written in revelation
Pardon me mister, well it's the eight-five resister to give
Your brain cell a blister so fine-tune your resistor
Every ghetto corner's goner so I think that should wanna
Take heed to the seed, once I plant it we can feed
Now we stuck on stupid in a state of unawareness
Makes us, fearless endearless
Recklessness makes us careless
This idiology, stupidity, lack of idealogy
Periodically destroys us psychologically
Cipher's dimension is viewed on dissension
Like a undetected chemical that creates mad tension
We all been inject now we all become infected
Ways and action of our people is the way that we detect it
It's gettin trifer, we should run the six sects
Taking tons of you now follow by, twenty-one ciphers
But we don't, cause we frozen, posin, at thirty-two degrees
That's no way for the chosen to be dosin
The time is running out, tick-tock, like the grains of sand
Every man sharpens man, like steel sharpens steel
The threat of a war is real
Where my soldiers for the battlefield?
The time is running out, tick-tock, like the grains of sand
Every man sharpens man, like steel sharpens steel
The threat of a war is real
Where my soldiers for the battlefield?
Cause right about this time, they tryin to trace my moves
By simple things like bills, they tryin to mark my location
At home or on vacation through my ChemicalBank card
They tryin to kill the God and through my food feed me lard
It be that lesson temptation for them devilish type creations
Making the black mind feeble with they thought pattern Evil
Like Kneival, or conniving, got no time for eighty-fiving
It's time to educate instead of wasting all our time
We goin to hell in a handbasket, fell into a casket
Cause for drastic measures, we should all stick together
Final Call, we better heed instead of chasin after cheddar cheese
Before we back to slavery commitin acts of bravery yo
The time is running out, tick-tock, like the grains of sand
Every man sharpens man, like steel sharpens steel
The threat of a war is real
Where my soldiers for the battlefield?
The time is running out, tick-tock, like the grains of sand
Every man sharpens man, like steel sharpens steel
The threat of a war is real
Where my soldiers for the battlefield? It ain't no mystery .. 
"Who is that?" "
The Supreme Black Man, that's who
!" 
"Hoo that's the man!"  It ain't no mystery
"Who is that?" "The Supreme Black Man, that's who!" 
"Hoo that's the man!"  It ain't no mystery
Well can you tell me where to find that Mystery God
I don't see him, so you know the shit is kinda hard
I searched and searched, but still there's no sign
It's gotta be a trick for the deaf dumb and blind
Now would you set up home, and wait for a Mystery God
To bring Food, Clothing, and Shelter?
Emphatically no!
Mathematically that just don't go
See me and my people been lost for over 400 years
And done tried this Mystery God
And
all we got was hard times
Hunger and nakedness, from the snake that hissed
Beaten and killed by the ones
Who say, "Look to the sky for your piece of the pie"
And didn't want to tell you that God's within self
Bloodsuckers of the poor wanna keep your wealth
Keep you a slave, so you don't misbehave
You never know the truth til you're dead in your grave
That's when you wanna come back, but there ain't no haps
Traps, caught you like a good strong buck, now you're fucked!
But my Third Eye helps me see
That the Black Man's God and yo it ain't no mystery
 It ain't no mystery .. 
Who is the Mystery God, have you seen him?
You can keep searchin for a trillion years
Keep spreadin dates but he never appears
Crazy delusions of a big white man
Sittin on the throne, magic wand in his hand..
"You go to heaven! Dude, you go to hell!"
Churches think this mystery seems to sell
Join the 10%, duty to sell the eighty-five
You got part of your salary when this old God arrives
I'll be gone, jetti, I nix comedy spook
John ? is foul, but he still know the truth
Organized crime, drop you off in America
Land of the brave, watch the man from the cave
Used to kneel to the cross for the war with the rappers
Used to think it great, to rest ? in plates
Used to pray on my knees to the Mystery for G's
But instead of gettin G's all I got was free cheese
And bad advice, a tie around my neck
Shoot on my collar, to cut off my breath
But now all that's over, reality rules
Deal strictly with the gospel of the ? schools
Preacher preacher you could never be my teacher
Dealin lies and deceit for some brothers from the street
Know that the Black Man is God 
There is no mystery
 It ain't no mystery .. 
"Who is that?" "The Supreme Black Man, that's who!" 
"Hoo that's the man!"  It ain't no mystery
"Who is that?" "The Supreme Black Man, that's who!" 
"Hoo that's the man!"  It ain't no mystery
First soul, black like coal
The Original One, with the power of the sun
Allah's God, always has been always will be
Never could be, a fuckin mystery
But you pray for Jehovah to come
That'll be the day when you leave the slum
Until that time, you just keep eatin swine
Drinkin cheap wine on the welfare line
Who's the clown, that didn't paint Jesus brown?
Everybody knows the man was original
When the jam is over I'mma go and take my vegetable
Check buy a tech let loose in the Vatican
Courts writin lies, record company is mad again
They say "Sadat X is racist"
Because I love the black faces
So put your bible in the attic cause I didn't come for static
The True and Living G-O-D
It ain't no mystery
 It ain't no mystery .. 
"Who is that?" "The Supreme Black Man, that's who!" 
"Hoo that's the man!"  It ain't no mystery
"Who is that?" "The Supreme Black Man, that's who!" 
"Hoo that's the man!"  It ain't no mystery"Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh"
"Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh"
You tried to do me, you tried to do me 
You tried to do me, but I am not the one
You tried to do me, you tried to do me 
You tried to do me, but I am not the one
Why you wanna live so foul?
You know, sweatin', one for some, is not my style
I'm the type to wine and dine and the candlelight
Cause just one night could be just so right
Your first riff is that I'm never home
And you're sick and tired of bein' alone
But baby, I got work to do
And ain't no one gonna stop me from bein' Pu'
I buy you rings and things and all that good stuff
But you still beefin' that that is not enough
Let's sit down and discuss it
Baby bust it 
You check my beeper when I'm still sleepin'
When I get out of cars, you're out your window peepin'
I think the best thing for you and me
Is just to play like John Lennon and let it be
You tried to do me
You tried to do me, you tried to do me 
You tried to do me, but I am not the one 
You tried to do me, you tried to do me 
You tried to do me, but I am not the one 
I would sing the song called, "Just Be My Lady"
But you're the type of girl who likes to act real shady
And rain on the brain like a hurricane
Throw rhythm on a dame, 'cause I know the game
You see, I'm just a rapper and nothing's free so...
"Why are you watching me?"
Well honey, can I get some privacy?
You say "cool," then you try to flip
But you forgot to put the Gucci bag upon your hip
You knew me, you blew me, others would pursue me
The question that I ask is why you, tryin' to do me?
Make like a ship and just float on 
I'm not the type of brother that you can just gig on
I know the time honey, there it is plain to see
You're tryin' to do me
You tried to do me, you tried to do me 
 You tried to do me, but I am not the one
You tried to do me, you tried to do me 
You tried to do me, but I am not the one 
"Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh"
"Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh"
Now see, baby
I don't know why you tryin' to flip and all of that
Cause I'm out here tryin' to do my thing and get these papes in today's society
You know what I'm sayin'?
I'm tryin' to make things a little better
But if you wanna make matters worse, let me say this first
There's no need for you to try to do me
You tried to do me, you tried to do me 
 You tried to do me, but I am not the one
You tried to do me, you tried to do me 
 You tried to do me, but I am not the one
Good times come, honey, good times go
I think this is somethin' that you really oughta know
The name of the game is to maintain
Cause when you lose someone you love, then you feel pain
It's up to you to decide if the love was worth losin'
To me you're not the everyday, Tina, Tammy, Susan
Why can't you, understand?
Instead of tryin' to run the flim-flam on the Grand
Baby, do whatever is clever
Cause we can make this last forever and ever 
With joys, there's pain
But don't you worry about the Puba Maxwell, cause I can stand the rain
Shoo-be-doo, this is what you oughta do
Think of all the things that I just told you
Remember all the times when I used to hold you and say
We can last through eternity
But don't ever try to do me
"Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh"
"Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh"
"Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh"
"Ugh, ugh, ugh, ugh"Quand je chantes ma galère la la lère
Ça fait je chante ma galère la la la la lère
La vie a balafré mon âme depuis j'ai du mal à gardé mon calme
Ça ne fait qu'aggravé mon cas
En tout gravé mon blaze dans le Top Ten
Des plus mortels
MC carrément barge
Nubi légendaire
Qui ose convoiter mon mic
Tous ces enfoirés sont die
Faut pas comparer mon bail 
Moi je suis vraiment vraiment scarla
Je suis tellement tellement dalle dalle
Je suis un enfant de la dalle
Et tu seras frappé par le malheur si tu me cherches ou si tu parles mal
Le jeu de la rue c'est un sport d'équipe
Pris dans la mêlée, fais la boule comme un porc-épic
Sur-entrainé comme les corps d'élite
C'est la 9.1vasion, fermez vos gueules et vos portes et vite
Claque du beat, mack le bizz, je suis la pute de personne
J'ai fait mes classes dans les rues de l'Essonne
Pack de 6, passe le spliff, rien ne nous impressionne
Mes bougs, c'est des soldats, c'est des hommes
Oh oh !
Écoute, ton flow est balourd t'es chelou
Tu crois que tu pèses mais t'es t'es pas lourd, t'es relou
T'es la honte pour les gars de ta clique
Tu gâtes ta clique, moi je veux que les cœurs de mes lascars palpitent 
Vous et nous c'est pas les mêmes bails
Quand on rime c'est pas les mêmes vibes
Et quand on frime c'est pas les même eyes
Nous on est des princes
Nous on est comme vous on est des pinces
On n'aime pas cracher l'oseille
Quand on gère un pain on lui fait raquer l’hôtel
Si on met la capuche c'est pour ne pas cramer nos têtes
Sauf pour un biz légal et honnête
Comme placer nos textes et déclasser vos tapes
En plus Nubi a le niveau pas de rivaux
Pas de bluff, pas de mytho
T'as l'seum, il y a ce qu'il faut pour calmer tes nerfs
J'zone pour les noirs et les fiers avant la quête d'une gloire éphémère
9.1 fier représentant
Fier comme le fait d’être le père de mes enfants
Fier, fier de ma négritude
Et il s'avère qu'à travers la verte je recherche la plénitude
Mais je reste vif sur les disques
Les jeunes partent en couilles et tire sur les kisdés
L’appât du gain, difficile d'y résister
Mais t'étonnes pas de voir les vil-ci te pister
Je te parle de ce que je connais
1ère che-arra, j'ai la rage depuis l'collège
Et je la garde près de moi jusqu'au dernier soupir
Pour mieux me souvenir qu'il faut souffrir pour vivre
La vie ça va vite il faut courir pour suivre
Ça m'tue d'me dire qu'on peut mourir tout de suite
Alors à chaque couplet c'est le chant du signe
Mon flow sale coule comme le sang du crime
Claque du beat, mack le bizz, je suis la pute de personne
J'ai fait mes classes dans les rues de l'Essonne
Pack de 6, passe le spliff, rien ne nous impressionne
Mes bougs, c'est des soldats, c'est des hommes
Oh oh !First up it's the knots up, what's up
To the niggas from the projects
Prospect Park in Brooklyn, I'm lookin at another crime scene
Committed by the brothers on this rhyme team
Just freestylin' in a cipher, might take the life of MCs
If you're wack we got the right to seize
Ease back like Ultra,
know your culture
Motherfuckers don't know so they won't grow
Lord Jamar show and prove the rules I kick
Makin niggas move, no matter how smooth it get
Or how rigid, niggas still get it
I kill wicked motherfuckers with the rhymes that I structures
In my third eye, know you heard I
Study math like a mathmatician
See half of y'all wishin you could sound like the GODs from the town
Of the Rule, you ain't got the urge, bust it down Serge
You know I smoke it like the flame to the tip of that bud we just twisted
From another dimension, did I mention
That funky, that's the only way we know how to get
Niggas' rhymes be limited like a partial scholarship
But my style's so heavy it make me lean when I drop
Leave you spinnin like the washin machine before it stop
Going all out, have to seal these motherfuckers fate
On a mission from Cleveland, ridin it from outta state
So ready yourself because it's on full scale
I hooks up with Jamar to bail down to New Rochelle
Now Rule, that's where we scheme and we plot
On the late night, blunted in the basement with Sadat
And we discussin your demise, know it's gonna come
Sure as the sun's gonna rise, send me the drum
And Serge is buckin off a shot from the mental with insight
Air tight, while we're working from cradle to gravesite
I feel lick a shot pum pum, push up on the one
All bang bang and no run
Original Flatbush style, control the jam
Like BEEP Han Solo man
Yes-a, Mr.Intellect-And-Sex in the flesh
I'm rougher than the hair on your girl's chest
Maestro Manny one verse, time come in
My mic ??? stop when they go for it
You don't concern me, your style can't burn me
You's about as hardcore as Big Bird, Bert and Ernie
My steelo fat like your girlfriend, pregnant with twins
After Thanksgiving then they're eatin pork skins
I don't give a fuck about your section, just watch your
murder
flexin
Step correct to the brother with the dark complexion
6' 1-2 even, cocked diesel
Conceited, hair is curly, ain't no fuckin up like ???
SEE!!!!
*Interlude*
When the corrupt stuff on my mind starts to erupt
Even the hard niggas will be yellin "That's enough"
But what about my style, ooh child, I switch em up
Rearrange em up, in other words I change em up
Snagglepuss, I make a nigga fall like the season
So exit stage left cos you ain't on my level even
You wanna battle? Here's what happened to the last kid
His wife became a widow and his kids became bastards
In the rap profession, I'm not the one for testin'
I'm the first to let'cha know I fight dirty like mud wrestling
So bring all the flunkies you roll with
So when I set it on you they can all be like "Oh shit!"
You want more so here we go, peep how my rap flow
I'll have your ass sneaking out the backdoor
This is some trouble you don't wanna get your ass in
So watch your step and don't come out'cha mouth in the wrong fashion
Feel the wind blow through your hair
My aim is square on your backbone
You're home alone and your mom work the double shift
Just enough time for me to hit that off
"Bounce on a nigga" said my man Wop
Peace to the squad, One-Eighth, Fo' and Teepee, check it
I'm the type of nigga that'll walk down the street
On some casual shit, even my kid could flip
Hear me on the wop tape BAM!! HIT EM
Hear me with the rhythm, yo you better go get em, check it
Anticipation, you're waiting and waiting
Peace to Courtland Ave., Teepee wheelnose in
Satan, the early bird, aiyo that's my word
My man Joon with the herb to the moon
Eh Shawn Black, nigga, where ya at?
No type of daydreamer or a nigga with emphysema
This is X and I'm straight from the RuleIntro: Busta Rhymes
Brand Nubian '98, hot shit for your ass
Get up everybody, make your ass move fast
Check it out, like this, check it out
Let's dance, I know you got the feeling
Let's dance, come on and get down
*repeat x3*
Verse One: Grand Puba
One time for your mind and it just don't stop 
Chickens flock, I hit you wit dat knock 
I be the Grand Royal makin it hot, flame broiled 
To this I stay loyal while your style goes spoiled 
One of a kind, I'm like a diamond in the mine 
Brush of the dirt and watch the Haji God shine
Mama Pu, Mama Pa, Mama Grand Puba 
Alamo, Dotty X and the Lord Jamar 
We wanna party , fiesta 
Together , forever 
Say word, son, a nigga flow like Chandon
Champion, been in more cooties than a tampon 
Grand Puba Nubian co-workers 
Specialise in music, these cats'll never lose it 
Time for some action for your satisfaction 
Stackin Benji Jacksons without no procastinatin
Chorus: Busta Rhymes, 
Let's dance, I know you got the feeling	
Let's dance, come on and get down
Let's dance, I know you got the feeling	
Let's dance, come on and get down
Let's dance, I know you got the feeling	
Let's dance, come on and get down
Let's dance, I know you got the feeling	
Let's dance, come on and get down
Verse Two: Sadat X
Here's a simple joint that a baby could follow
I had wrote some twisted shit that niggas just couldn't follow
Love Vivica, Nia, Pam and Tamia
Soul Food with the cornbread, greens and head 
I'm off-ramp while y'all camp under a street lamp 
I got a stamp from back then, remember when you was ten
But now you're burstin, enough to make me u-turn on Lennox
Watch your mouth, this a grown man with the grown plan 
And a swift hand on the witness stand
Before the grand, I can't go out on my man
I know nothing of the sort, never seen a transport 
Wax built thors and cats who open doors 
Can get it in their paws when I release my youth
Down with Jamar, he's in the B-K, Haji in the Rule
Known Alamo since birth, young boys we went to school
Family planner, I can't forget my daughter in Atlanta 
Chorus
Verse Three: Lord Jamar
Yeah
Light-skinned, understandin see with brown eyes 
Seen me in the van, the streets of Crown Heights 
Wit weed in my hand, runnin lights 
In need of a grand to put down on a fight 
See me and the Brand Nubians keep it tight
Flew me in to do a show in the middle of the night
If we don't get our dough then you know we're gonna fight
Keepin niggas on their toes cos our flows be right 
I used to bag hoes on sight
Now it turns me off when their clothes be tight, I'm on the road of the
Right 
And just, when I was 15, I used to smoke dust
Now I strive to stay pristine and free from lust
Watch the 3 bust, I be the Black G-zus 
Attack any man who plan to freeze us
Your hand should be up, my man's be tree'd up 
In a land that the black man needs to free up!
Chorus: Busta Rhymes, 
Everybody let's dance, I know you got the feeling
Let's dance, come on and get down
Let's dance, I know you got the feeling	
Let's dance, come on and get down
Let's dance, I know you got the feeling	
Let's dance, come on and get down
Let's dance, I know you got the feeling	
Let's dance, come on and get down

J'me sens bien, y'a d'l'air dans mes Nike
De l'herbe dans mes niaks et la merde veut pas faire dans l'détail
Tu t'la racontes avec des rimes à la con
Tu mords à l'hameçon mais tu n'piges pas la leçon
Joue pas les ruff (
mec
) t'en as pas l'étoffe (
mec
)
Ici les petits poissons se font ger-man par les choff
Comptes-moi parmi les prédateurs, j'ai de quoi te donner des vapeurs
J'traque tous mes détracteurs, ils craquent sous l'effet d'la peur (
craque
)
Faut qu'tu saches que rare sont les vrais rappeurs, les 3/4 sont des acteurs
Leurs raps sont révélateurs, crime, frime mais devant les shtars ils sont des délateurs
Ils aiment flamber devant un micro
Mais dans la rue ils rasent les murs comme un clandé dans un comico
Bref, ils sont pas aussi vrais qu'moi
Vu que, j'traîne tard là où eux ne viennent pas
C'est ma planète, froisse l'instru, squatte au coin d'rue
C'est là qu'j'suis bien, sans ça j'suis rien
C'est ma planète, les gardes à vue, les frères aux shtars t'as vu, tu sens qu'j'rap la rue, parce que
C'est ma planète, paroles d'un MC légendaire
Les vrais reconnaissent les vrais, les autres, on les emmerde
Eux, ils sont pas aussi vrais qu'moi vu que, j'traîne tard là où eux ne viennent pas
J'me sens bien, j'ai des beats qui tabassent
Des rimes qui arrachent et derrière y'a les p'tites qui jacassent
Mais j'ai pas l'temps pour les groupies, j'veux d'l'argent
J'ai des soucis qui hantent mon sommeil, qui veut m'empêcher de prendre mon oseille (
qui
)
Si je l'vois mourir à l'ombre, j'irais l'étendre au soleil
Chaque jour je tente d'être honnête
Mais y'a pas d'sous, ça m'saoule, il est temps d'reconnaître
Que la rime paie peu, on m'dit qu'le crime c'est mieux
Moi j'dis cousin j'vise les cieux
J'lâche pas, la rage parle comme un pit' teigneux
Quand j'rime tellement j'brille tu plisses tes yeux
Quitte les lieux, j'suis du type haineux (
aaah
)
Mon rap choque, toi tu rappes soft sur un beat mielleux
T'es corrompu comme un flic véreux
Moi j'représente les miens, tu sens v'nir l'émeute, 9-1
C'est ma planète, froisse l'instru, squatte au coin d'rue
C'est là qu'j'suis bien, sans ça j'suis rien
C'est ma planète, les gardes à vue, mes frères aux shtars t'as vu, tu sens qu'j'rap la rue, parce que
C'est ma planète, paroles d'un MC légendaire
Les vrais reconnaissent les vrais, les autres, on les emmerde
Eux, ils sont pas aussi vrais qu'moi vu que, j'traîne tard là où eux ne viennent pas
J'me sens bien, j'ai les deux pieds sur la terre ferme
Le regard vers la terre mère, aucun égard pour l'adversaire
Un vétéran mais j'ai les dents d'un jeune loup
Tu dis rien d'intéressant, il était temps que je l'ouvre hein (
hein
)
Intelligence de rue, ceux qui mangent le plus
C'est ceux qui observent puis opèrent quand ils sentent le truc (
c'est ça
)
C'est mon tour de briller, ton tour de prier
À court de billets, j'suis venu pour te piller
J'veux ton disque d'or et ton 4x4
J'te laisse ton jean de fiotte et tes tass' crades

J'ai les crocs qui rayent le bitume
Et mes vers ont des airs de biture
Alors, fais bellek ça va te rapt à la tête
Et les mecs c'est du rap tah la tess, normal
C'est ma planète, froisse l'instru, squatte au coin d'rue
C'est là qu'j'suis bien, sans ça j'suis rien
C'est ma planète, les gardes à vue, mes frères aux shtars t'as vu, tu sens qu'j'rap la rue, parce que
C'est ma planète, paroles d'un MC légendaire

Hostile, légendaireVerse One: Lord Jamar
7 in the mornin, they kickin down my momma's door
Now tell me what is this motherfuckin drama for?
Can a nigga get rest after rest without the stress?
Then they put the Glock to my chest
Best think 'fore I twitch or I'm popped
Off to the clink with this bitch ass cop
They gotta nigga locked like the dread on my head, jack
And if I try to fight back, well then I'm dead, black
I got the right to an attorney and to stay silent
They got the right to try to burn me if I play violent
I know the game so I just roll with the procedure
Illegal search and seizure, somethin that they're doin at their leisure
Down at the station, interrogation is takin place
Overcrowded jails but for me they're makin space
Tell the devil to his face he can suck my dick
It's the whole black race that they're fuckin with
Come to find my crime was lettin brothers know the time
Only the devil is stoppin me from eatin swine
And plus my prior record sealed my fate
One For All
and In God We Trust got me
sent upstate
But still I won't bite my tongue
I just write tight shit to incite the young,
to fight the one
Who keeps them on a level that's minimum
That's the number one reason
Chorus: 
This time and day
Ooooh, gotta run for time
This time and day
Ooooh, gotta run for time
*repeat*
Verse Two: Sadat X
I was frustrated, I can't do no more push-ups
Niggas be swole up, locked down cos of a hold-up
"The devil made me do it" is what I say
Got some bad news on my one phone call the other day
"I love the kids and I teach em to love their father
I'll get you some kicks and try to send some flicks
But it's over, baby, yes it's over"
Ain't much you can do when you're holdin a phone
A million inmates but ya still alone
You're not cryin but inside ya dyin
You might cry in the night when ya safe and outta sight
Damn I miss my peeps and the rides in the jeeps
And my, casual freedom, where's my crew when I need em?
A visit ain't the same like being in the game
But I'll take it, at least with that I'll make it
The beast is a bitch and I see it
I do the knowledge to em, so next time I can do em
"Yo X, I got ta lock it now but write me real soon
I know that you're a busy man, give me a minute"
You can never know the penal til you been locked the fuck up in it
Chorus:
This time and day
Ooooh, gotta run for time
This time and day
Ooooh, gotta run for time
This time and day
Ooooh, gotta run for time
This time and day
Ooooh, gotta run for time
 
This time and day
Ooooh, gotta run for time
*repeat to fade*On prétend aimer la vie qu'on mène
On est minés par la haine
Et on crève à p'tit feu
Chaque jour on se détruit un p'tit peu
On est pris dans l'engrenage mec
Ouais, on est pris dans l'engrenage
Garde des amis près de toi et tes ennemis encore plus proche
Jette un œil à gauche à droite quand tu sors du porche
Parce qu'ici la vie ne tient qu'à un fil
Si fragile, c'est tragique, boy c'est pas un film
Si t'as un team une équipe des gars intimes
Dis-leur de se préparer la guerre est déclarée, si t'as un fils
Dis-lui que tu l'aimes, embrasse ta femme
Et fais semblant de croire qu'elle te remplacera pas
La mort y a plus que ça qui nous freine
On a le mord et les remords c'est vraiment pas ce qui nous gène nan
Sauve qui peut les femmes et les tits-pe d'abord
Mate ceux avec qui je marche tu verras qui veut ma mort
On crève à petit feu la rue nous éprouve
On dit que tout est cool mais au fond tout s'écroule
On est pris dans l'engrenage, on trime sans relâche
On veut prendre de l'argent pour prendre le large
On rêve de vivre vieux à défaut de vivre mieux
On jure de se ranger un jour si Dieu veut
Mais on est pris dans l'engrenage et puis on prend de l'âge
On veut prendre de l'argent pour prendre le large
On court après le bonheur, on sait même pas ce que c'est
Aller taffer de bonne heure, c'est pas notre tasse de thé
On veut des liasses en bordel, un niax au bord des lèvres
Un cœur au bord des larmes, on sort les glaives
On se lance corps et âmes dans une guerre où on tue nos propres re-frè 
C'est comme tirer sur son propre reflet
On court à notre perte, côte-à-côte avec celui qui coupera notre tête
J'avoue que ça m'obsède
J'y pense souvent, on oublie pas tant de souffrance
On avance doucement, œil pour œil, dent pour dent
C'est tout ce que qu'on a retenu des livres sacrés
Et aujourd'hui, certains sont condamnés à vivre caché
Ou vivre cloîtré dans une cage, classé dans une page des faits divers
À cailler sans une maille en pleine hiver
La vie personne n'a dit que c'était cool
Mais vaut mieux éviter les couilles c'est moins dur que d'esquiver les douilles
On crève à petit feu la rue nous éprouve
On dit que tout est cool mais au fond tout s'écroule
On est pris dans l'engrenage, on trime sans relâche
On veut prendre de l'argent pour prendre le large
On rêve de vivre vieux à défaut de vivre mieux
On jure de se ranger un jour si Dieu veut
Mais on est pris dans l'engrenage et puis on prend de l'âge
On veut prendre de l'argent pour prendre le large
À chaque goutte d'encre qui roule sur le papier
Y a mille gouttes de sang qui coulent dans le quartier
Ça crève les yeux dès qu'un frère fait feu
Un autre ferme les yeux et part chercher Dieu
Rester pieux ? Souvent difficile, tous dans l'illicite
On court au bord du gouffre, on se pousse dans le précipice
Parce qu'on a tous les dents longues
On trouve le temps long, ici on ne bouge que dans l'ombre
Es-tu près à donner ta vie pour tes biens ?
Ou même ôter la vie pour les tiens
C'est la question, anticiper l'agression
Réagir, ne pas défaillir devant la pression
C'est la vie et je dis une prière en rap
C'est vrai qu'on aime les virées en cab', déchiré en boite
Que Dieu nous pardonne et puisse ôter l'angoisse
Qui nous ronge et nous plonge dans un océan d'glace
On vit sur le fil du rasoir quand on y pense ça file le cafard
C'est comme une mère qui voit son fils au placard
Ou comme toutes ses phrases dites au parloir
L'oseille et le sexe nuisent aux scarlas
On crève à petit feu la rue nous éprouve
On dit que tout est cool mais au fond tout s'écroule
On est pris dans l'engrenage, on trime sans relâche
On veut prendre de l'argent pour prendre le large
On rêve de vivre vieux à défaut de vivre mieux
On jure de se ranger un jour si Dieu veut
Mais on est pris dans l'engrenage et puis on prend de l'âge
On veut prendre de l'argent pour prendre le large
Ouais en vrai on rêve tous de se casser de là cousin
Tu peux me dire que tu la kiffes cette vie ?
Tu kiffes ça cousin ?
T'aimes ta galère ? Nan, nan
C'est pour les familles qui prient
Les mères qui triment
Les pères qui taffent
La vie c'est réel cousin
, dans les ghettos c'est unda my man
On est là, on racaille mais
On est pris dans l'engrenage en vrai t'as vu
Pour tous les frères qui luttent
Ceux qui essayent de s'en sortir
C'est juste un peu de force
T'as vu pour les frères normal
My man Zeblé ici, brice-Fa le grizzly aussi ici cousin
Parce qu'on est pris dans l'engrenage frèreThe Godz must be crazy!
I said The Godz must be crazy
The Godz must be crazy!
They said The Godz must be crazy, cause I let my hair go wild
Lookin like a nappy nigga child
Black folk say, "Cut that bush"
Quicker than George Bush, drugs get pushed
They want a nigga clean-cut like the Ancient Greeks
But the Ancient Greeks, were fuckin freaks
I'm gonna let it grow like a forest
Ain't choppin shit down, that's why I hear the sound..
Some days I wake up mad and I don't feel like hearin shit!
Put all your talkin to the curb Jack, you don't even know me
Keep thinkin wild, crush a kid when live, big on stage
At a show, not even fuckin up my cool flow
But this country luck's breakin, there's a war against the righteous
But I got a gun, and the God got one
And his man got one, and we gon' all be armed
The scope is aimed at the White House, and still they say
The Godz must be crazy..
The Godz must be crazy!
They say The Godz must be crazy
The Godz must be crazy!
(Nobody do I need! Bitch back up!
You think The Godz is trizznippin?
You flexin! You betta watch yo'self!)
They say The Godz must be crazy, cause I don't bow to the cross
I even had a Priest get tossed
Teacher of lies, kept his sword
And when you do, you're gonna praise the Lord
Of all things I could, but I don't splurge
Won't submerge myself, in material wealth
Just health and well-being through All Eye Seeing
But 85% of y'all is disagreeing
See the Black Man is God and that's an actual fact
But everytime I scream it yo I'm under attack
With the crack on my people like a monkey on the back
Bust it in the brain, fuck it if it leave a stain, no pain no gain
Black Man, change your demeanor
It's gonna be some shit, when they unleash FEMA
We're headin, for Armaggedeon, I'm only spreadin the facts yo
But since I'm black, they say that
The Godz must be crazy
Uh-huh, The Godz must be crazy!
They say The Godz must be crazy
The Godz must be crazy!
One day I seen a riff, it was three against one
Became three against two cause the one man was black
Now three against three cause Mark the Spark was with me
Four against three cause Daddy-O from Stet was there
Was the odds fair? Have they ever been?
I proceeded with this plan to cut a hole in the grafted man
But then I chilled, I'll wait for the war..
.. then I can off much more!
Skulls on the pavement, bones to bones
Sawed-off, mix it with, micraphone
Whole blocks, filled with, pools of blood
Stars and Stripes burned up in the mud
C-Cypher-Punks jump up to get beat down
Play around with the X and get your eye split
We're goin two to the head Sadat X broke bread
Who said The Godz must be crazy?[Intro: Sincere &

Hey yo, God, we need somebody to come drop some science on this track
Word up, word up
Ya know, tell it like it really is in the world today
Word up
Yo, there go that brother Grand Puba
Ah, he don't know nothin', he don't know nothin'
He talkin' about skins all the time
God
You know what I'm sayin'?
Yo, bust this
The attribute Hagi helper to another god
In need He Allah God Islam
As I proceed to civilize the uncivilized
Word of wisdom to the groove from the wise
I guess I'm like the Verbalizer for the fact I'm movin Blackwards
This Asiatic black man is a dog spelled backwards
The maker, the owner, the cream of the planet earth
Father of civilization, God of the universe
Manifestin' thought with my infinite styles
Making sure this travels only twenty-three million miles
The other six I set the crucifix
Because the heart of the problem is this
Preacher got my old earth puttin' money in the pan
For the rest of the week now I'm eatin' out a soup can
He has a home, drives his caddy through town
Has my old earth believin' that he's comin' from the ground 
Slain are those who fought for what was right
Slayed are those who fell victim to the pipe
A drug controlled substance, contained in a vial
Set up by the devil as he looks and he smiles
Good at the game of tricknology
But I have knowledge of myself you're not foolin' me
You see, the answer to me is black unity
Unification, to help our bad situation
I wrote this on a day of Wisdom Power
All bein' born to myself 
I won't diss the next brother to be paid that's not my trade
It's just the plan that is designed by the colored man
Now our babies are born to think this is the way of us 
That's the way the devil wants it so it is no fuss 
It's just that sad old song self-destruction
To stop our reproduction
They put our wisdom before us 
That makes it wisdom knowledge 
But we need knowledge wisdom
To bring forth the understanding 
Culture freedom 
Power refinement 
Equality God Build Bestroy Born's our cipher 
No, not nowadays bro
Why Equal Self, a trader made an interpretation
Saying that we'd receive more gold for our labor in his nation
Now Cipher
It's time to drop the bomb and make the devil pay the piper
 What? *3x*
Wake up wake up wake up
Come on
Wake up wake up wake up
I want ya to listen to me
Wake up wake up wake up
Come on now
Wake up wake up wake up
The solution -- knowledge of self to better ourself
Cause I know myself, that we can live much better than this
Nothing's changed, it's just another sequel
The devil's still causin trouble amongst the righteous people
Drugs in our community 
Can't even get a job 
Poisonin' our babies 
Lyin' who is God 
Well here's some food for thought, many fought for the sport
And the black man still comes up short?
It's time to motivate, build and elevate
Blind deaf and dumb we've gotta change their mindstate
So I dip dip diver, civilize a 85er
Gotta let him know the devil's a conniver
This is the plan from the brotherman
From the motherland now it's time to take a stand
I keep strivin' to do my duty to awake em
To the universal family I say asalaamalaikum
Yeah..
Now I gotta give this shout to my Brand Nubian brothers
Lord Jamar, God Allah
Derek X is on the flex
Alamo is good to go
Sincere, the God is in here
Move on black man, move on
We gotta move on black man, move on
We gotta move on black man, move on
We gotta move on black man, move on
Yeah
Now I gotta give a shout to the SD50s
For putting this in effect
And I'm gonna say it like this before I motivate
Please.. educate Allah's children, with equality"Say one for the treble, two for the bass
One for the treble, two for the bass" 
"Say one for the treble, two for the bass" 
"And I'm guaranteed, I'll steal ya 'ho
When I'm on the microphone doin' my show" 
Well everytime I rock a rhyme that show Jamar is intellectual
Girls, STILL wanna get sexual
They try to pull me offstage, hopin'
That we can engage, in some sexual escapades
Grabbin' for the jewels of the fam
Actin' like they never seen God rock a jam
In they lifetime, grabbin' my lifeline
To flow fluid like Alaskan pipeline
Now brothers get jeal' when they see the God swell
Mad, 'cause we got your girl under a spell
Me and her had a talk, and yo she said she wouldn't tell
Now I got her on a train on her way to New Rochelle
Your girl wanna stroke but yo I didn't provoke
Now I got a leg behind a head and a yolk
And next time bring a friend for my man Sadat X
And
Sincere
, who's hittin' honeys from the rear
Goin' strong, lastin' long, 'cause he drinkin' a stout beer
We don't fear if your man blood boil
'Cause we know a place with some nice soft soil
So check the heartthrob, proceed to rob ya 'ho
By the way, we rocked the show
"One for the treble, two for the bass"
"Say one for the treble, two for the bass" 
"And I'm guaranteed, I'll steal ya 'ho
When I'm on the microphone doin' my show" 
A quick move at a jam, homegirl got her hand
In my pocket, yo' girl, the one you call "sweets"
Dreamin' 'bout the X and ruinin' her sheets
I'm kinda cool black, aight?
I mean I'm straight on the girl tip, but when your girl
Do a dip with her skirt on you know it puts a hurt on a daddy
So check it, you know the crew that wanna act like that?
Wanna play the front with the poom poom fat?
Talk about your man, yeah yeah he got a gat
But at the end of night, you in the ho-tel
And if you ain't all of that, you play the mo-tel
Yo I ain't the one for it if you can't control your girl
Take her by the pants and put a lock on it
And if that shit don't work, then throw the Glock on it
Mad stacks and numbers but I can't remember faces
Much less places, but I DAMN sure know the races
Strictly for weaker or a sweet soul sister
Be thankful that I didn't hit your girl I could've DISSED her
But I lounged and maintained
But don't front cat, yo don't slumber
I still know honey and I still got the number
So you be cool aight?
"And I'm guaranteed, I'll steal ya 'ho
When I'm on the microphone doin' my show" 
"One for the treble, two for the bass"
"Say one for the treble, two for the bass" Uhh.. yeah.. then they say

Now who's this nigga in the 4.6?
About twenty to five, got a truck full of chicks
Just leavin the disco, me and my man from the Knicks
Oak Dog, later on because they live in the Bricks
Jumped on the George Washington and Now Jeru' turnpike
Head feelin right from a long-ass night
Whoa, I see Jake, so I let off the gas
So I was doin fifty-five when I passed his ass
I looked over, caught the shine from the
rim of the Rover
You know his next move  pull it over
I pulls over to the right-hand shoulder
Look through the rearview he got his hand on his holster
He had this look, "How this black nigga get this car?"
You know these cracker state troopers don't know rap stars
He asked me for license and my registration
Seen my New York tags and he asked me my destination
I said, "Vacation," handed him my registration
Papers were straight so I didn't wet the situation
Got my shit back, and that was that, but that wasn't that

Miss Judge Lady in a courtroom can dictate
A fee for me, to pay monthly
Even suggested, that I be arrested, they don't count
The time invested or the bond beyond the money
They'll hit you with arrears, bad enough to bring tears
They been on my back for years, fuckin with my license
And everytime I'm stopped by Dick I see the Booking
That making me violent in this wilderness land
Now can we talk for a minute?  Cause we both made this child
Can we leave support alone, please take me offa that file
Cause everytime I see the court my blood pressure rise
And the heart attack is a killer of black guys, I stay civilized

For all my niggas Po-Po shot in the back
Robocops with the crack, they'll never get props
From the black folks, lock us up while they crack jokes
And stack notes, when we payin the bail
Knowin damn well a nigga's gonna stay in the jail
It's all made for us to fail, the dog is smarter
Than the tail, but if the tail was smarter it would Wag the Dog
I can't wait til we bag the hogg
New York State of Mind doesn't mind, murderin my kind
We even got our own converting across the line
He turned swine, guess his ass'll learn when he burn

I ain't do shit!  Jakes lock a nigga with a weed clip
Couldn't believe it when he took me in
Threw me and my man up in the van, a seven hour stand
Ridin around watchin them arouse the black man
I had the afghan I just copped from the record shop
Took it up the block my usual spot, when I
Rolled the L, I never expected to go to jail
I wish they'd all go to hell
Now Guiliani wanna talk about the "Quality of Life"
Think he got the right to follow me at night
With no probable cause, other than my skin is black like yours
Now they got me in the beast, sittin right in his jaws
Up in Central Booking, yo people looking knowing that

And you know it don't stop until the party ends
So get your hands up high, if you feel me reply
Cos you know these brothers here we keep it extra tight
Look, listen and observe, it took precision to connect
The words of dialect within a rhythm you never heard
Forbidden fruit, take a bite, you could lose your life
Like how they crucified Christ Musa's hair was white
Lord Jamar, Sadat X and Puba's here tonight
We got next on the court, I don't know what you thought
This flow can't be bought, only sold
In exchange for platinum and gold, you've been told
Open up the manifold only to reveal scrolls and scrolls
Premeditated to be dedicated to lost souls
Properly educated, never sloppily operated
Playing the beats for all my people incarcerated
We stay in the streets and find new ways to eat
Crime wave, I remember wetting my feet
In my blind days, now these niggas getting they heat
From under they seat, I wonder when the guns'll deplete
Brand Nubian brothers here to flip it again
And you know we don't stop until your party ends
So get your hands up high, if you feel me reply
Cos you know these brothers here, we keep it extra tight
The Foundation, as we hit you with a Brand Nu creation
New millennium we don't mess around
Do the knowledge as we blaze the situation, so just feel me now
I'm in a rush, who got the keys to my truck?
Who am I? I just might be a spy
I drop a tear at the sight of the blue NY
I'm a threat just like Garnette
Pick a player out my set like Marbury, serve me sherry with a cherry
I always eat what you think, I ain't got no shoes on my feet
I'm from down the street, huh
Now cats ride around New York with the slick hot rods
Some late model usually pushing full throttle
Hanging illegal U's and staying with the gleaming shoes
Riding one deep but back to back to back
Fuck a buzz, it's gonna happen just because
Sure I was with her was, but I don't know what she does
Big dimes hit me everytime like it's a crime
My prime will steadily climb
Yeah, I can't release nothing to y'all before it's time
Brand Nubian brothers here to flip it again
And you know we don't stop until your party ends
So get your hands up high, if you feel me reply
Cos you know these brothers here, we keep it extra tight

New millennium we don't mess around
Do the knowledge as we blaze the situation, so just feel me now
Now my verbal illustration graphic more than Playstation
Microphone occupation operation save the nation
Black crusader, persuader, educator
Knowledge detonator none greater
Leave haters stuck like a project elevator
Always jammin it airtight like a laminate, you can't contaminate it
Go-getters we be superb like Justin's catfish fritters
Now I got 2000 flows, only 4 less than all of my hoes 
Oops I mean my bro's but I'm just keeping y'all on your toes
Excitement for your enlightenment, spitting novels, getting bravos
Tear it up like El Nino, keeping it hotter than jalapenos
Microphone holder doing more damage than rolling boulders
Rhyme style should've fooled ya, knocked your head  right off your shoulders
See my intention, black-on-black prevention, break the tension
Teach the seeds, tell them what they need and then collect my pension
Brand Nubian, baby, born more flows than a test tube valve
Your radio ain't really on if Brand Nubian ain't on your dial
Outro: Grand Puba
Yeah, as we do it like this
2000, Brand Nubian comin atcha one time
New millennium styleFollow me! Upon a Black Star Line
Off for the rest and for Brand Nubian
Now go to Africa again, watch dis!

 Black Star Line  It's the Black Star Line
 Everybody come aboard  And free your mind
It's the Black Star Line that's leavin' at nine
Here's a paid ticket so you can free your mind
Playgrounds is filled with visions of steel
Grab the black babies IT'S TIME TO BUILD
See we got a mental ship somethin' like Noah's Ark
Spark your brain cell now let's set sail
 we flowin' on a positive trip
All Nubians is welcome, male and female

Love vibes rule so your black face is cool
Cool, but not frozen, a trip for the chosen few..
Form a line-ah, upon the Black Star Liner
Goin' to Africa, one more time 
Form a line-ah, upon the Black Star Liner
Goin' to Africa, one more time, TRUE!
Let me tell you bout Marcus Garvey
Born in Jamaica, God left him in country
He go to America to make black people free
He walk around low and just try make money
Him buy up some ship and just start for we
America or Africa and live irie
We hav some man where wan gonna be
Young nasty and just licky licky
Some love Marcus Garvey, the place of peace
Or peace around it, and dem sparkle up him say

Writer no block it but just run follow me
Form a line-ah, upon the Black Star Liner
Goin' to Africa, one more time
Form a line-ah, upon the Black Star Liner
BRAND NUBIAN!! Tell dem one more time
As we look to the stars, they take ours
Yeah we got fly cars but you can live in four wheels?
We need new approaches, old style is null and void
Makes me paranoid, to think
That we own the whole ocean yet we can't even drink
You couldn't swim the nine thousand so we got you a means
Of transportation, for the Nubian nation
Marcus Garvey had the idea back in the days
Doin' for self, keepin' the wealth
I gotta add on and create
Though the devil thinks it's not the latest fashion
Navigatin' lost, somethin' like a ship's captain
Chorus
When I'm ova, arms will be raised for the tom-toms
Push up ya arm they call ya proud to be black 
Call me proud to be black, 'cause I'm not tryin' to fuck
When I'm proud to be black, I'm not some young eedyot 
Be gone! I want no dem I want no dem-dem dem-dem dem-dem
Never know they wickedness they haffa come to an end
Don't take a no fey word for de white boy dem
Awayaa TELL ME - all you get in de end
Awayaa TELL ME - all you get isa dem

Brand Nubian wanna give NUFF respect to the one Marcus Garvey
NUFF respect to Red Foxx
Sting International in the house
Dave Kennedy on the boards
KnowhatI'msayin'? The one Rafael
Nuff respect to the God Sincere
Yeah, yaknowhatI'msayin'? Mark the Spark is in the house
And umm, this how we work out
For the ninety-two seasonYeah, black woman
This one goes out to all the black women across
The whole planet Earth, givin our black nation birth
Nothin in this universe is worth your worth
So we dedicate this song, black woman
This one is for every woman I was ever with
The ones that I cared about and ones I just wanted to hit
I feel ashamed for all the times that I called you a bitch
And I, know I was wrong, can you ever forgive?
The negative, we used to use sex as a sedative
I abused your respect for me
I would choose to react disrespectfully
Never thinkin the impact would come back to me
Now I'm the son, and I know you're my reflection
Let me give you love and my protection
Proper education Allah's correction
Eternal lies, within your eyes
I hope you realize that I apologize, for all the lies
I never meant to make you cry - all the mistakes that I
May have made, and games that I played
Been put to an end, black women
Let me take this time, to let you know
You've been on my mind, and even though
I always haven't been kind
I wanna show you that you really divine, sincerely
Now she's the most beautifullest thing in creation
She give me motivation causin constant elevation
Seein more than booty used in lustful situations
So feel the vibrations, she's the mother of our nation
Now for oh so long you stood by us so strong
Even when we done wrong, so I dedicate this song
More priceless than a worldly treasure, you bring
Love joy pleasure, countless things that are unmeasured
Some raise seeds all alone with no father in the home
But they still find the strength to continue on
I see you more than a crackhead or a chickenhead
Or just a piece of somethin I'm tryin to get up in my bed
You often say a lot of times we demean
Sometimes we do to lift the hardhead ones up to queens
Our whole purpose is to give a proper surface
Cause the black woman always is a queen
Let me take this time, to let you know
You've been on my mind, and even though
I always haven't been kind
I wanna show you that you really divine, sincerely
My fondest thoughts and memories go out witchu
And I'm sorry for that time that I hit you
The finest lights you radiate, you lookin bright
And that's why I love you with the chocolate skin
Finer things were never made in this world
There you are lookin like somethin worth somethin
Make me feel pride when you walk with me
Sit down and talk with me, for a minute
It's kinda hard for me not to stray
But I think I'm gonna start today
Hey I'm tryin, at least I ain't lyin
Send a rose to your wife, she probably saved your life
Put up with cheatin and she mighta got beaten
You can't build a _Foundation_ based on lies and deceit
I'm tryin to be right, I want my cypher complete
Let me take this time, to let you know
You've been on my mind, and even though
I always haven't been kind
I wanna show you that you really divine, sincerelyWell, there's mad gangs, but only one got control
Wherever they roam, from north pole to south pole
Ice cold with a vice hold on all crime
They gettin paid even if they shit is small time
All your dimes'll get took, yo watch them sling  them things
Cause they nothin but a gang of crooks
Things look like they'll be here for a while
Momi and Daddy better fear for they chile
Cause they style is not just makin a fast chickens 
They also into murder and ass kickin
Distortion and kidnappin, the kid is black
Handsome ransome they just get you your kid back
But either way they gonna make a loot
If they keep the kid he's gonna do a bit as a prostitute
Owin freak  for some T. A. N. G. 
From six  to sixty-six they count us catchin thick 
Shit sticks in your mind
Make a nigga wanna go out and fight crime
I write rhymes as an answer to they gang size
If they wanna jack your car you can sang mines
Gang bang Gang bang
Police ain't nothing but a gang #4
Date rapes, got the shakes since the first of the month
So you gotta play, the cheque cash close 
You know you gotta make up that loss
So when the cut was butt  and the work was dirt
A whole baggage fucked up ?), you know you're de man
You gotta head him off, if you still want the block
So he can look the other way, if he catch you with the Glock
All de cook up, he might give you the hook up 
So you don't get moves downtown in the tombs
New gang member, he's a rookie and his wid extortion 
He got a wife and his daughter wanna a pony
His man's a Columbian
And they both got they hands in the soup
And you gotta hit off your group
Niggers to be outside til like four in the mornin
Niggers with the toast so when the gang get too close
Naw a gang don't play by the rules and they up they demands
Gotta grease mo hands, gotta get mo work
Gotta get more weight, gotta stay up late
And travel out of state, hey fuck the gang fucks nothin
Niggers are bluffin, as they snatch you for the kidnap they don+t even
Show
Got fucked in the ass, so now who's the ho
Gang 88 , mo kinds of dicks, don't give a fuck about the brothers
As long as they get they cash, News flash
These kids is the worst, if you see 'em
Then you better hit em first
Don't shoot til you see the whites of they eyes
Hands and thighs, they might front and sell ya been pies 
Black man, don't trust those lies
Cause the gangs is a bunch of dicks
Gang bang Gang bang
Police ain't nothing but a gang #4
This song is dedicated to all the original gangsters out there
You know what I+m sayin NRPD, NYPD, LAPD, state troopers
And all the Pds in Queens, FBI, CIA, DEA, TNT, ATN, INS, FEMA, Interpol
National Guard
Coast Guard, Army, Navy, Airforce, Marines, Secret Service, and all the
Rest of the
Motherfuckin hogs out there rollin in the mud]
Pass me.. pass me the gat, I gotta fight back
I ain't rollin over on my motherfuckin back 
I need seven brothers ready to roll, I mean some real shit
Brothers ready to bust, bust again and again
Snatch the chains off the door my man, this is a stick-up
I ain't bring no funds, just came to snatch the guns
Check it, brothers spread throughout the whole damn store
Don't leave nothin, don't leave a witness
This black man is armed, another man's alarmed
This is the next Vietnam, set it off in the North
My moms is down with it, pops is committed
Something's got to give, I'm like a powderkeg
Ready to stick a bank, drivin a high-powered tank
Newsflash: Brand Nubian, takin fifty hostages
Take em in the basement,
feed the punks sausages
Funnel cakes and Jell-O, Twinkies from Hostess
Shoot the faggot in the back for actin like that
From New York, in the East, I'm the black man police
I called the cops for a beef that I had, but they didn't do
A fuckin thing, tellin me to tone down
As if they was a father gettin red in the face
And they threatened me with mace.. so check it out 
So now I'm the wise guy but they ain't tryin to bend
That's why I'm here to pretend..
Hey yo, pass the fuckin gat!
Pass me the gat, and just like that, I squeeze
Like a man posessed from the Old West
See I rest in Rule -- keep a tool close
You don't want be the learner that my burner makes toast
Cause today's mathematics is Uzi Does It
I got the automatic stashed in the attic
And it's an emphatic Now Cipher
If you think you take the life of me without a fight
Huh, I clean my gun with a riprod
Here comes the God who don't eat pig lard
Lord J-A-motherfuckin-M-A-R
Never passive, the crew grows massive
We get wreck with the tech, blow your mind with nine
Plus we got the shotty for your body
Rodney King ain't this God-ly king
Before I take a whippin, I'll dump a fuckin clip in
The police, who give us no peace, to be deceased
I'll have a feast, as I commence to slay the beast
So my advice to black men: stay strapped
Hey yo, hey yo yo, pass that..
Pass the gat!Intro:
Y'all niggas hurry up. Go in there, buck them niggas and get the fuck out
Don't be playin, dogg playin, yahearwhutI'msayin? Kill them niggas and get
The fuck back so we can stay ballin, we'll be chillin right here
"Eh nigga, I wanna know if you're ready to do this shit? You ready to do
This shit or what, motherfucker? And don't be actin like no pussy when we
Get the fuck out, man"
"Is you down, nigga?" ---] O-Dog
Well if you're down say you're down, if you're scared, say you scared
This is the real, don't fuck around and come unprepared
Or you might lose your life on the mean streets
Middle of the night when the motherfuckin fiends meet
Hold your grip tight yo, don't let it slip
You gotta keep your tool for the fools that wanna trip
And if they wanna trip, send em on a vacation
All expenses paid for a devil's cremation
Can't be no contemplation, cos if he busts first you're gettin burst, uhh
Layin on your back, I guess what I'm sayin, black, is that
If you ain't down then don't fuck around
"Is you down, nigga?" Cos the shit gets thick in my town
This ain't a TV show or a song from the radio
Murder on the streets, yo, is at a high ratio
So it ain't no time for playin
You takes the 9 and I'ma be sprayin
Now what the fuck's this look in your eye? You're lookin nervous, nigga
Earlier tonight you was all ready to service, nigga
Now your trigger ain't got no itch
You're attitude switch like a motherfuckin bitch
I can see thru your expression that you're vessin
Feelin crazy pet, lookin like you wanna jet
But now the shit is obvious, you just can't deal
I gotta find another nigga down for the real, "Is you down, nigga?"
Are you down for the real?
Real lifestyle's where niggas run wild
Day after day the product line is a mile
A nigga got his eye aimed on what's mines
I gots ta lay low cos my PO is thorough
He keep checkin every borough cos my address pad is thick
Niggas be actin wild cos they girl be on my dick
This kid downtown don't like me, he say he want me dead
He even put up cash and put a price on my head
At first I can't sweat it but my little man got hit
We had a lotta thrills but now he's buried in the catskills
Rumour has it, that bein with me's a target
My crew go less and less and I resort to wearin a vest
Ain't got no type of fans, just me and my mans
We be drawin up plans that include the use of guns
Try to stay alive so we can spare no use of funds
A month or two blows, a whole year blows
Are we still on our toes as we guzzle all the Moet?
Two drunken poets as the first shots hit
My man don't duck quick and gets hit in the chest
I just got nicked cos I had on the vest
Now I'm dashin, cars in the garage
Run past the Path'. run past the Dodge
Rumble for the keys, made it to my shit
The AK can spray now niggas is gettin hit, "Is you down, nigga?"
Are you down for the real?
Chorus:
Are you down for the real, motherfuckers?, "Is you down, nigga?"
Are you down for the real..............? , "Is you down, nigga?"
Now are you down with the real ass niggas? , "Is you down, nigga?"
Now tell me if you're down for the real? , "Is you down, nigga?"
*repeat*
"Is you down, nigga?" Yeah, yeah yeah yeah
One time as we do it like this, yeah
Grand Puba, Common Sense
Yeah, yeah, yeah
It's all love y'all  what you say?
Intro/Chorus: all, Common
 Maybe one day we can work it out
Strive to understand what life's about
All it seems to be is sadness and pain
Blood like rain clogs urban drains
 When we gonna realize and make the change
And take the blame, erase the shame
Cause new millenium is knockin at your door
The New World Order's what they got in store
Now I can't stress this enough, life sure is rough
You gotta go through a whole lotta shit
Just for you to get a little bit
Born into existence where your existence is non-existant
But your persistance overcomes their resistance
Your daily mechanism is your defense, whether it be
Past or present tense, don't be dense
I'm droppin this with Common Sense 
As we linger on into the darkness
Poisoned by society where high-anxiety is just one variety
Hatin each other is another, brotha
I mean I'm really true to the shit, my spit ain't just spit
My duty is to save my people from all of this shit
And if I can get somethin for doin that then I'm gon' get
And I won't quit
My ways and action manifest in my way of thinkin
I just can't stand around and do nothin
While my people sinkin
I told you that I stay true
And I gotta do, what I can do, when I can do, so
Chorus
Grand Pu...I'ma do....what I gotta do....what I can do
I
t's one for all like Brand Nu-bian, feedin the multitudes
Of five loads
, dead men walkin with lost souls
Some say the games are strange, our ways have been tribal
Since the days of Kemet, now displayed on Bennett
Revolution's like a pussy, I'm tryin to stay up in it
And our music is a message, though some is afraid to send it
I don't know much about the New World Order; I know I
Got a new daughter, direction and protection I must provide for her
The moral of the story I'm building...
Like ODB say, "We for the children"
Nike make a killin off us, we kill each other, it kills me to see that
You take a life for gold, nigga did you really need that?
We try to escape the mixtapes, rims and weed sack
And to the new age, they say the women's gonna lead that, so
Chorus
 Oh say it ain't so
 It ain't so
 My peoples at a all time low
 Double oh Pu'
 Nowadays we doin anything for dough
 For the dough doe
 Don't you know that knowledge is the note
 What?
 Know the ledge, don't hit the edge
The negativity pulls us down like gravity
 Yup
 Devilish ways and actions poisons us like a cavity
 Yessir
 As we send this one throughout our whole proximity
 Grand Pu' and Common strive to come together
In this era of prepaid calling cards
I roll with squads called the Gods
Ignorance is at large, struggles in our backyard
I slapbox with life and see we wasn't that hard
Long as you got God, even got Gramps off lah
It's stray lies and bullets directed, to lead the village
Of lies disconnected like ghetto phones
Fuck a search through a magazine for Better Homes
It ain't gonna happen
Til the devil's gone with the breeze
And niggas get off they knees so...
ChorusUhh ("
through the coming years
") through the coming years
("
life, will grow sweeter
") life is gon' get much sweeter y'all
("
through the coming years
") Through the coming years
("
life, will grow sweeter
")
Now I heard the silliest shit from this crackhead bitch
I asked her why she smoked that shit, she said "we all can't be rich"
She said, "I'm hopeless, like a penny with a hole in my soul"
Then she asked me my goal, I said to live to grow old
And watch my seeds grow and teach those who need to know
And if my shorties need me, deliver like Domino's
See the name of the game of life is maintain
Your mind won't grow if you can't feed the brain
Through the coming years a lot of blood, sweat and tears
Poured a lot of beers for my niggas who ain't here
My pops used to school me - I'ma keep it real with you
You can play the corner all you want 'till one day it's gon' get you
Got to get up, get out and get something
Or you can sit around all day and do nothing
See that's the main reason why that we pour a lot of beer
'Cause there's mad niggas gone but the corner's still there so
("
through the coming years... life, will grow sweeter
")
("
through the coming years... life, will grow sweeter
")
They say you only get better with age
Fine wine gets better with time, fruit get ripe on the vine
Truth bring light when it shines
I'm at my best, like Tyson in his prime
And that goes for the raps and the beats
I make songs for those trying to escape but trapped in the streets
And y'all 'bout to see that I'm 'bout to be on MTV
Looking off a penthouse balcony
And I've been fucking with birds like falcons, we
Off the handle and steel like alchemy
Just for keeping it real like Malcolm, G
OD it'll all reveal
When they, crown me king then you all will kneel
I'm 'bout to, drop some shit that you all will feel
The seed's been planted, now look at all the vegetation
I'm trying to see my family straight for generations
Give me my reparations
("
through the coming years... life, will grow sweeter
")
("
through the coming years... life, will grow sweeter
")
I'm not the richest, not by far
And I ain't got 24 inches on the car
And I doubt that you'll ever see me at the car show
And I work every day, ain't got that star dough
But my daughter keep me grounded
Surrounded by good friends and my brothers, and a few others
That I met on the road, like here and abroad
And the Brand Nubian name remain with respect
All of us still here and that's much more than a check
Still growing and our family correct, tap the bottle
And I guess you could say that I'm a role model
Of how to make it without hitting the lotto, and that's life
From a man to a boy, from build to destroy
We born again, yo it's back on again
One more trip across the globe
One more run for the roses, the door never closes
Until we shut it right
("
through the coming years... life, will grow sweeter
")
("
through the coming years... life, will grow sweeter
")Désordre organisé
Par la loi et ses soldats
Hommes et femmes condamnés
De sa colonne dorée
Il dessine des schémas
Des plans sinistres perdus d'avance
Car les temps changent

Nul ne peut l'ignorer

Que l'on se bat et se battra
Qu'en est-il des promesses
Réponses vaines à la détresse

I'll keep, holding on!
Young black male, twenty-five years of age
Many-a-lives didn't survive to this stage
Cause the rage of another brother got him popped
Shot him and he dropped, like a beanbag
Mean motherfucker with a rag and some jeans that sag
They signify your death by crossin out your tag
Then they go and brag that they took another life
Never to think, do a brother got a mother and a wife?
Trife when a nigga do the work of the Klan
That's what you're doin when you ruin the life of a black man
Attack plan on self
The man's got the family jewels, so I guess we're buryin wealth
All because we've been taught to despise what's black
Open your eyes you oughta realize the fact
That you've been gettin used like a trick
You think you're mighty, but yo, whitey got your head sick
See you were fed thick pieces of swine as a baby
It only help to drive your mind crazy
Now your blind days be over
No more standin on line, tryin to find Jehovah
Let us rewind to a time we was right and just
Nowadays we just fight and bust
One another in the back over crack, a carjack
Will get you killed, watch the blood get spilled
To the scale, then watch how fast they build the jail
Now they got you holdin on to a cell, well...
I'll keep, holdin on
I'll keep, holdin on!!
I'll keep, holdin on
I'll keep, holdin on!!
Why it gotta be me B? I just came to chill
Came to see the flicks, nuttin more nuttin less
Try to show love even on a bad day
I roll up, I'm never hold up, the L is swoll up
The beef in the mind is definitely a winner
Oh that's that rappin nigga, I thought he was much bigger
Do you know this girl named nah B I don't know nothin
Did that name-game shit right from the go get
Shorty want an autograph, can I sign it at the end
Oh I think I'm all of that now, so now it's fuck Brand Nubian
Should I call you a bitch, or should I maintain?
I'm just here with my lady, and you came witcha man
This would force him to front, and I'm sure he don't want it
Over some old bullshit, when I'm quick to pull shit
Live dad, everything is everything
I got a lotta shit to do I can't afford to catch a charge
I'm a product of the streets, and I couldn't make no peace
All the real hard shit I know, is on the down low
Straight for real estate, on a scale I place your fate
Now I'mma let you skate, you was a little weeded
And I seen you don't need it
So hold on with your bad self...
I'll keep, holdin on
I'll keep, holdin on!!
I gotta hold on!
I'll keep, holdin on
My word is bond, I gotta be strong
I'll keep, holdin on!!
And keep holdin on, yeah
Ya see life's gettin rough but I gotta hold on
All these little suckers want me alone
Yeah, yeah, yeahhh!!
Ya see life's gettin rough but I gotta hold on
All these little suckers want me alone
Yeah, they want me alone

Le respect avant l'or, le diamant, le fric
J'pense à l'honneur des miens avant de vendre des dix
Tous ceux pour qui j'suis prêt à prendre des risques
Le rap est un art ou une arme
Plus dangereux qu'un pétard ou une lame
Tu fais ton choix : une pétasse ou une femme
C'est c'quon appelle
le libre-arbitre
Combien de MCs ont choisi de sucer bite par bite
Au nom de la vie d'artiste
Et c'qui m'attriste
C'est qu'dans leur rap game ils travestissent ma street
Putain j'ai plus la trique, j'ressens plus la 'sique

moi j'ai la frappe de Cantona
C'est l'Essonne, c'est les soldes le 12 à 40
En une demi-journée on peut refourguer toute la camelote
Ça pousse, ça crie, les bougs s'agitent
Ils savent que "sale" est une marque déposée, comme la
Blue Magic
J'suis béni, j'suis un bien-aimé de Dieu
À part la paix dans le Monde on n'pourrait rien rêver de mieux
C'est l'album ton cœur palpite
T'es pris d'une peur panique
C'est des années de souffrance et des milliers d'heures de pratique
J'ai versé mon sang dans une cartouche d'encre
Ton rappeur préféré peut s'mettre un mic où j'pense
Ok, tout ça c'est cool mais en attendant
J'entends c'que t'écoute et j'dis qu't'es sourd ou malentendant
Gros c'est quoi les bails ? Parle-moi !
Non écoute moi
Je viens d'où tu viens j'ai toujours dû jouer des coudes, moi
On m'a dit qu'j'étais voué à l'échec
Et en cas d'réussite jalousé par les traîtres
Triste sort
Il semble que ça risque fort
De tourner au vinaigre
Tu crois voir un film gore
Quand tu vois s'dérouler nos vies d'nègres
Mais laisse tomber les violons
J'attends mon heure, on m'a dit "laisse le temps au temps" mais c'est trop long
Moi j'ai plus la force de patienter
Même plus le cœur à chanter
J'me nique la santé à tenter d'avancer
Et j'donne tout avant d'commencer à flancher
Ouais ça passe ou ça casse, mais faudrait penser à un plan B
Non ? Tu crois pas ?Peace to the Gods, peace to the Earths
Peace to the positive people of the universe
Brand Nubian came to work it like this
Ya see, each, and every day
Each, and ev-ery wa-ay
We're gonna show and prove
Teach you the righteous way
Peace, to All-ah, and justice, and ju-stice, justice!
Peace, to All-ah, and juuhhhhstice!
The knowledge, is, the foundation
The wisdom is the wa-ay
The understanding shows you
That you are on your way
...
The culture, is I-God
The power is the truth
Equality only shows you
That you have planted your roots
...
God, came to teach us
Of, the righteous way
How, to build and be born
On, this glorious day
...
The knowledge, of, the cipher
Is, to enlighten you
True that true that true that you know
That God is right inside you
...Celle-ci est une dinguerie
Elle frôle la psychiatrie
J'ai soigné mes plaies mais j'aime trop mes cicatrices
Tu vois c'que j'veux dire, ma rime est visuelle
La vie est si cruelle
Prie pour moi si tu m'aimes
J'essaye de rester cool ooh, mais j'ai le sang qui bouillonne
J'suis là pour prendre un billet, tu peux garder la couronne
J'ai une grosse équipe
Pour nous tu n'es qu'une proie hypothétique
Hargneux, colériques
Armes soviétiques
On tire sur l'État, entends-tu les coups d'feu ?
On plane au-dessus des lois parce qu'on fume beaucoup d'beuh
Les frelos passent la frontière chargés comme des mules
Abreuvés d'une violence téléchargée sur eMule
Les études sans les thunes c'est mission impossible
T'es un modèle si t'es un joueur de foot ou un grossiste
C'est pas ta faute Maman, t'as fait c'que tu pouvais
Le quartier fut un père pour ces petits que tu couvais
Alors je fume pour oublier que j'ai mal au cœur
Le hall sent la taule pourtant on m'dit qu'l'argent n'a pas d'odeur
J'reste scar-la jusqu'à dead
De A jusqu'à Z
Et quand ça sent le soufre j'allume la mèche
Beaucoup d'stress, fume la verte
Beaucoup d'rage, beaucoup d'colère
J'en ai beaucoup bavé depuis l'collège
Beaucoup d'boloss disent qu'ils m'connaissent
D'où ils m'connaissent ? J'suis pas leur pote !
Wesh la famille ! J'suis pas leur zinc !
Ils veulent un feat, s'en battent les couilles de savoir si mes enfants mangent à leur faim
Putain d'rap game
C'est toujours la même sale crève
Mets-toi un doigt et fais un tour sur toi-même
Et je lève bien haut mon majeur
À tous ces labels pourris
Où sont-ils aujourd'hui ?
Seraient-ils tombés dans l'oubli ?
Tu ne peux pas durer si t'es dans l'faux
Face à face tu peux pas m'tuer, faut me tirer dans l'dos
La France m'a déjà tout fait, j'ai subi les pires tortures
J'suis le fruit d'un viol : que Dieu maudisse l'âme de cette ordure
Mon ADN raconte une tentative de génocide
Maintenant tu comprends pourquoi j'ai jamais été docile
La mémoire dans la peau, je suis Jason Bourne
Marianne, dans ma piaule, faut me souhaiter bonne bourre

Désolé pour l'attenteT'es prêt à t'priver d'ta vie pour ta diva
C'est pas du vent
Tu dis « t'aimer m'rend téméraire »
Comme c'est divin
On cherche l'amour sans trêve
C'est qu'sans amour, on crève
T'échangerais une promesse du paradis
Contre ma paire d'yeux
Regarde-moi de loin
Comme si mon garde du corps était dieu
J't'avais pas vu dans la mire
Un pavé dans l'amour
Endure tes vers pour entendre les gens dire
Qu'tu m'rendras légendaire
On cherche l'amour sans trêve
C'est qu'sans amour, on crève
Tu veux partager c'que je suis
C'que j'vaux, c'que j'vis
C'que j'vois, c'que j'ai vu
Et après on verra
Si l'amour meurt, alors dis moi c'qu'il reste
Des cases vides, des causes injustes
Juste des gestes
Tu dis qu'tu tuerais pour moi
Trouve une cible émouvante
Prouve-moi que tu m'aimes à mort
Au moins autant qu'tu t'en vantes
La balle au bout du fusil
Le fusil à bout de bras
Du braconnier à bout de souffle
La balle siffle
Un corps s'affale sa vie défile
Le bourreau s'tire dans la foule
Et moi,

, je reste couchée
C'est moi qu'il a touchéCool-ass Al, he got a badge from the neighborhood yo
Fly police car, the ninety-two mod-el.. now check it out
Now Al used to rob, used to smoke, used to steal
And he rolled a mean game of dice
A factor boostin he was nice as he proved on the daily tip
At Macy's, he and this kid up in Lacy's
Throw his head to blow when he turned into a Fed
I seen him, one day, I tried to get inside his head
There's two fit ill, Glock cops, with passion
Black shoes fit, like they was made, from ashes
Another brother, a sister or somebody's pops
And when I see Al, he never stops
Unless it's to make an arrest
He can't kick it, unless he writes a ticket
He got a nasty way, attitude everyday
It makes me kinda mad cause I really can't hit him
But brothers scheamin to get him
At any level the worst devil is a black one
And if you see one you gots to attack 'um
One day, I had the cell lit, up on Lewis Park
Cool Al appears, backs up, fresh Clarks
It's a hot day black, and the sun's beamin down
But I gotta get on the ground?
You're, sworn to whitey, do you think that you're mighty?
You take the honor of bein the black Bull Carter
It's a shame cause use done out your righteous name
For a little rank and more fame
You're whole style is chump, you forgot to use the pump
So instead of warnin brothers, better hide and take the picture
You know the brothers wanna hit ya
So carry your gun, especially off duty
Don't forget that there's a price on the booty
Hidin upstate won't make you safe
By the way, are you of Christian faith?
Then prepare to meet your Mystery, become a place in history
Force come shot down with some brothers from Uptown
And if we're not totally through
Then you'll be left black and blue
Man these black ones is just as bad as the motherfuckin white ones
They get a BULLSHIT badge, and think that they God
But yo I ain't havin that shit, I put a hole in they fuckin ass
Then they see who's God
Comin in our midst causin this motherfuckin confusion?
I send that ass back to the essence quick fast
I knew a cop named Roy, a good nigga boy
To pull the trigger on another brother was a joy boy
Didn't give a FUCK if your face was black
He'll blow out your back, and say you sold crack
He'll see you in your car and don't like your look
He got beef with gold teeth so now you're a crook
Flash the lights, pull to the right
Put up a fight, well say night night, cause Roy boy might
Pull out the heater, for him there's nuttin sweeter
Eight to your head, from his nine millimeter
Roy had a thing about young black males
He wanna see em dead or either locked in jail
Down with every drug bust, for him it was a lust
Kickin down doors is like dickin down whores
I remember when he was a rookie, a tough cookie
Beatin down kids for playin hookie
You see Roy is the type of ne-gro
With a alter-ego that's illegal
He like shakin down niggas on the block
Take you face down, let you hear the sound of the hammer cock!
No need to fill out a report
Cause everybody know Roy doesn't get caught
Now he's feeling like Superman
To the trooper stand, with an Uzi in his hand
Now Roy's gotta answer
The pig's gonna get smoked like cancer, sticks
For all the tricks that Roy's ever played
Toy with the wrong nigga, boy you get, sprayed
For all the fucked up shit, that you put a brother through
Black man, learn to love you
Cause even if you're dead, me and my crew
Will beat you in your head, and leave your ass full of lead
Black and blueYeah, yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah, uh-huh
Chorus:
U for me 
And me for you 
One for all 
That's the way we do 
U for me 
And me for you 
One for all 
That's the way we do 
Verse One: Grand Puba
Yeah I keep truer, sidestep MC's like manure
Play the corner like a sewer, keep it milky like Kahlua
Ya heard my shit be off the optimately optimate
Once a nigga begin to spit, get ya high like trees and shit
That's it, then I push it uptown to the Bush
Yeah I moosh, watch me hook it off like a Nike swoosh
My conglomerates reign dominance with prominence
Son, a lot of niggas thought I was done but I only just begun
Can y'all feel me because we feel y'all can
Smoke the tree right off the tims, long live Brand Nubian
My rhyme flow be imported, got so many different styles my shit is assorted
Never distorted, wanna catch my flow, better camcord it
I'm a take you there, believe me yo
See I'm here like welfare, got so many niggas livin my nickname should be
"Air"
You for me, me for you, that's how we do, 99-to-two-thou Brand Nu
Chorus:
U for me 
Me for you 
One for all 
That's the way we do 
U for me 
Me for you 
One for all 
That's the way we do 
Verse Two: Lord Jamar
Yeah, we engage the enemy, arrange the assembly
Flip thru the pages of time, do you remember me?
Thru the ages I existed only as a memory
Some of me exists inside your biochemistry
I be the slave that always misbehave, runnin for days
The North Star help me find my way
I ain't got no time to play, I'm trying to get away
Bloodhounds tryin to track me down, tryin to bring me back to town
If they catch me they just might ax me
Won't arraign me, they probably hang me
But it's freedom or death, exert speed til my last breath
Can't half step, Whitey's on my trail
I'm ridin on the underground rail, hidin from the face that's pale
Me and Harriet, Swing Low Sweet Chariot and take me home
They wanna break my bones and take me where they keep the tombstones
Chorus:
U for me 
Me for you 
One for all 
That's the way we do 
U for me 
Me for you 
One for all 
That's the way we do 
Verse Three: Sadat X
Let me find out, y'all tryin to dine out without me there
It can't happen, why is ya still yappin?
I'm known by college grads and then by anyone who all knighted
Why you so excited? You scarin chicks and grabbin em
Talkin bout cabbin off the bat
Relax nigga, you here with me, we don't get down like that
I keep 13 with one in the ass, you Catholic mass
Nobody wants to die and be a mural on the wall
I'm the apostle y'all, I'm like Samuel L.L
But I'll swing by you like Eve with a gun in my sleeve
Weed spots is like my need spots, let freedom ring
Sadat X Luther King
I wanna 1000 from the housing, don't know how much the club allows in
But I told the bouncer, I said "Yo that's not my fault
There's no need for assault", push and hit the asphalt
Now I'm a peaceful man, would you do for me, or is it......
Chorus:
U for me 
Me for you 
One for all 
That's the way we do 
U for me 
Me for you 
One for all 
That's the way we do 
U for me 
Me for you 
One for all 
That's the way we do 
U for me 
Me for you 
One for all 
That's the way we do ...The poor have been made into slaves by those who teach lies.
They don't teach the law of cause and effect.
They make the people believe when they see it rain, that a spook is producing it. But the rain is real, how then can the cause be unreal?
You are witnessing conditions in the world that are produced by real men, but you don't see the real cause of the effect of your own suffering. Because the Bloodsuckers of the poor make you think that God is some mystery God
Well, the Honorable Elijah Muhammad said to us that there is 5% who are the Poor Righteous Teachers, who don't believe the teaching of lies of the 10%. But
this 5% are all wise and know who the true and living God is, and they teach that the True and Living God is the Son of Man, the Supreme Being, the Blackman of Asia. They are also known as Civilized People, Muslims, and Muslim Sons.
Here is a small percentage of people who know God, and when they know God, they have a duty
And that duty is to teach what you know to those who do not know. Then, those of us...those of us who are in pursuit of that duty have 10%--the rich, the Bloodsuckers of the poor, the slavemakers of the poor--they hate the 5%. They have control over 85%. So they turn the 85% against the righteous teacher. This is how they've been able to kill the prophets, kill their communities. Because the leaders, who are the Bloodsuckers of the poor, have control over the minds of the masses, and they feed the masses more lies about a righteous teacher so that the Righteous Teacher will be persecuted by the 10%, not helped by the 85%, so that they can kill the Righteous Teacher

Verse One: Lord Jamar
Three sixty degrees I stand in the square, right over left
Preparin to fight to the death, you could never stifle this
Not even the triflest, nigga on Earth, could ever fuck
With what I spit in a verse, we always hit where it hurts
Underground so we dig in the dirt
Always gotta put a nigga to work, is how it seems
It's kinda hard to hear the silent screams
Through the violent things, turn a deaf ear
Your body might get left there - you better step to the rear
We put it down with Premier, rock mad army gear
You ain't heard us all together in, several years
It's like a federal crime, you had to settle for rhymes
That lacked substance, we got that in abundance
Pro-black and you know that
We stay Fat like Joe Crack, Lord Jamar
Come too far, to ever try and go back

Verse Two: Sadat X
I'm on 110 and Lenox with these Africans overseein
Our physical being, and how we doin it
It only take one bad nigga to ruin it, pursuin it
And actin like it can't happen put you in the chair
To the bookings we go, on the twenty-four hour flow
I run through obstacles, take off my shackles
Proper backing with the bangers and the rhyme singers
I run with dem and others, rock NY in colors
With the straight brim and the chick who work in the gym
The great Datty in the C-Town Express
Whoever step to this is gonna have to face stress
Whoever step to this better be at they best
Look at me close I'm the perfect host you standin too close
So back up, you should never try to act up
The Wild Cowboy still got the style boy
One of a kind I throw a helluva line

Verse Three: Grand Puba
Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah
My man Primo hit me off with the plural
Zig Zag Zig like Zorro now we makin more bread than Stella Doro
Unsung hero bring more _Heat_ than DeNiro
Never known for spittin trash shit on the mic, that shit's a zero
Rhyme flow stay off the meter, tight like two-seaters
Make y'all get nuts like a cellblock filled with dick beaters
Make my approach then shorty's bagged like coach
Cut on the lights if she ain't a dime then watch me run like a roach
Y'all know my shit be hot they call me Dr. Doo-a-lot
Now I got seeds so I'm stingy I keep strings on my Benji's
So tree up, nigga we up, about to re-up
Y'all know the deal, grab this paper, dissapear like Copperfield
I need a meal, time to eats with a flow
Drop the beat, press it up, and hit the street, dinnertime's complete
My Nubian ways'll get ass that open for days
Make more chips than Frito Lays when I spit the phrase that pays

 "Raised in the ghetto singin songs called survival"
 "Give a shout if you know what I'm talkin about"There's no emotions that make me feel this way
There's no emotions so bright to soothe a pain
How could it be so strong ?
Coz' when the time has come to escape from the storm
Just a little bit of this makes you feel so excited
You'd better pass it on
Before you're too stoned
Natural Nubian Vibes
Feelin' so high
Temperature rising
Makes me feel so Irie
Temperature rising
Feel so free and special
When the smoky notes fall down on my head and heart
It is so real
Wishing it'll last forever
Coz' I just can't stop this rythm enchantment
Feelin' high
So high
Temperature rising
Makes me feel so Irie
Temperature rising
Ain't no way to stop this voodoo charm
From your left to your, right just pass it on
It’s getting hot in here
Kweli and Les Nubians you got to hear
How we get so hot that the block is clear
I ran hot in New York since conscious man, yo
Last week I met APT
With this fine ass African facing me
We got to leave, where we going, she said basically
I roll with heat where you at is place to be
Wow, it’s so packed, it’s so close like I’m inside of mind living
I want my sheet smelling just like her
I said peace to Bobbito I’ll grab her by the hand
She like damn, Kweli, and pulled me close to dance
You ain’t gotta get deep to go soul searching
I’m hot but you gotta stimulate my whole person
I said I’m feeling you, I keep it real with you
I enjoy spiritual lives, so what's the deal with you
Feelin' so high
Temperature rising
Makes me feel so Irie
Temperature rising
Hey, Hey
Feel high
Throw your hands up in the sky
Move on side to side

Mes soucis me paraissent tout p'tits
J'suis parti sur un coup d'speed comme un coup d'feu
Et vu d'ici la planète n'est qu'une petite boule bleue
Au fait, moi c'est Nubi sale je choisis ma façon de planer
J'suis dans les airs, sur les ailes d'un avion de papier
J'suis un pilote chevronné j'ai beaucoup d'heures de vol
Dès mon premier décollage j'avais déjà fait des collages
J'ai beaucoup d'heures de colle !
J'suis un libre penseur, qui méprise les censeurs 
La rue aiguise mes sens, j'avance sans vices et sans peurs
Et j'suis pas invincible , encore moins bionique
Mais fuck Superman il pourrait pas fumer ma kryptonite
J'suis ailleurs , j'suis perché
Assis sur un nuage, un orage pour me bercer

Et si tu veux m'suivre c'est à tes riques et périls
J'suis toujours en décallage, et brutal au démarrage
Trop haut pour les radars, trop d'flow pour tout ces bâtards
Les pieds sur Terre, mais la tête dans les nuages

Tourne autour du soleil, flirt avec les comètes
Spliff en l'air pour mes taulards de Fleury jusqu'au Baumettes
Prisonnier d'un monde sans pitié
Je suis devenu un objet violent non identifié
J'suis dans mes mathématiques, j'ai créé ma propre matrice
Ma chirurgie réparatrice pour effacer mes brûlures et mes cicatrices
Je t'aime Marie Jeanne, te quitter j'arrive pas

Donne moi la zamalia ou la somme d'Amaria
La naturel de Colombie à bas la cocaïna

Bienvenu à bord vous êtes sur Mary Jane Air LineNow let me tell you something
It's all about my own thing
Now I know what's sweet
I know what is sweet as sugar cane
History takes me back to the basement of our culture
I can't hide myself anymore
Beneath this so-called disguise of civilized men
The sands of time is what I've been made with
The hand of the past may help to lay back relax, relax
If we check it now
And what you've got to do is just take care of
That inner black beauty that shines through
Your mela, mela, melanin tone
And take care of everything you got visible and invisible
For not so long ago they didn't love none of us
At all, at all, at all, at all
Now let me tell you something
It's all about my own thing
Now I know what's sweet
I know what is sweet as sugar cane
Now let me tell you something
It's all about my own thing
Now I know what's sweet
I know what is sweet as sugar cane
And the promises they made
At the times of struggle and fight must provide
You know, changes in your mind
For life is for the Lord
And all praises are for the Lord, the Lord, the Lord, the Lord
So descending from the
Tribe of Atkaptah will have to
Reminisce and unify on strong
So don't go dreamin' on the edge of their land
Oh no! No! You'll go flyin' high, you'll go too high
And now for the rest, let's remind the pledge:
Each time you'll taste the fruit of the cane
Don't forget the whip, the field, their sweat
Now let me tell you something
It's all about my own thing
Now I know what's sweet
I know what is sweet as sugar cane
Now let me tell you something
It's all about my own thing
Now I know what's sweet
I know what is sweet as sugar cane
Now let me tell you something
It's all about my own thing

I'd like to send this one to my favorite girl, uhh
Momma momma momma
Ohh momma momma momma, yeahh
Yo she was young and so tender
Had a baby born Knowledge God day of September
It was her first child, baby boy little bundle of joy
She married Larry, for 9 months she had to carry
Me and she did it gladly, but sadly
Things didn't all work out, so she merked out
Pregnant again with my brother Wise
My grandmother let her in, she had tears in her eyes
Now she's back at the crib, with 2 kids
She gotta get a job, she put all her faith in God
Naive to the world; believed all the stories
She received as a girl, she had one more seed
Another boy, reality, now that makes 3
All from a man that she hardly ever gets to see
She did the best with the things she was blessed
And I know I cause drama and stress
To my momma, so I wanna just say yo..
 + 
I always loved my momma 
And I always loved my momma 
See I always loved my momma 
Cause I always loved my momma 
Past feudin, mask for age, still lookin elegant
Front page, Ebony Jet
Pam Grier threat in seventy-four
What these bitches is wearin now, she wore before
On tour she said you just stay pure I say sure
Watched my sister's son and my little one make me fool
When the po-lice came she said that she hardly see me
I'm in the living room drinkin beer and watchin TV
She say that she love me but sometimes I don't think
She wish I wouldn't smoke as much and throw up when I drink
I think, that it wasn't no day finer
That when my pops snatched my mother up from North Carolina
And my uncle snatched her sister and brought her, right behind her
She like china, you won't find a heart finer
The designer, I'll shoot for my moms, yes I will
Shoot you in the side and let you live a spill, hehe
Uh - at childhood I never really understood
All your heartache and pain and how difficult it was for you to maintain
To make sho' yo' seeds eat
Even if we had to foodstamp it every week
Always did your best to try to keep us out the street
If niggas didn't listen boy that ass got beat
'Member that time you said, "Have yo' ass upstairs by 9"
But I was grown and had some other shit in mind
Word is bond, 10 o'clock she came downstairs
With rollers in her hair and a nightgown on
But I was gone, ran through the back, cut through the laundrymat
Got upstairs and still caught it with the Hot Wheel track
But that was cool with me; cause at least
It wasn't in front of the buildin for the whole prjects to see
I remember as a kid, sometimes I used to think
You used to beat me for some shit that my daddy did
I realize, now I'm older and wise
When you used to put it on me still had love in your eyes
I remember what you used to say
You might not like it now, but you'll thank me someday
Thanks mom, I love you
For teachin me left from right
For showin me the proper way
Uhh, yeah
Momma momma momma - aight
Ohh momma momma momma, yeah
Uhh, to all the beautiful mothers, in the world today
Who strive to do they best, I know it's hard sometimes
But we wanna let y'all know we recognize
And we love what you do, keep doin what you doin
One love, Brand Nubian

Got the right approach, plus my pop had wins
Seed trickled down, six two and brown
When "Slow Down" came out, at first it was MILD hit
A minute or two later, brothers on some WILD shit
Listen up, capture how I spree
Is it you, or is it me?
Made a mad verse, from first, stole second
Took the third and home it was out
That's what I'm about, that Nubian swing
Familiar ring, cash register ring
Pay the brothers, Jack the Ripper work hard
Then I'll be out, check it out, yo Peace, God!
Brand Nubian rock the set! 
Yeah
Fuck it up
Nineteen-ninety-two, uh!
Like this y'all
Well now this is for your clubs and your old school pubs
Where niggas get drunk and give in to the funk
Speakin of funk, this here be stink
The brothers up North can smell it in the clink
Well put down the Right Guard cause you got the right God
Matter of fact, we're comin right and exact
We got the brainiac style like Miles Davis
Save us, in the files of the shit that hit
It's time to make a run, a five hundred yard dash
Five hundred G's sold and the shit went gold
Now was that bold, to predict while I kick it?
Brand Nubian fights, against the weak and the wicked
I got the baldhead dread Sadat and Sincere
Oh yes, the God is in here
_To the Rear_ makin shit sound clear
Plus collect the dough at the end of the show
Everybody know Brand Nubian kick that shit on stage
Cause the fits and the rage
Lord Jamar turn the page cause this rhyme is overflowin
And bring in the funky horn
Brand Nubian rock the set! 
To really know this flavor you must understand the method
I might come up with a style, throw it down and say it's tired
Write a next one, smokin a blunt on the rooftop
And runnin with the sneakers or aiyyo hightops
Thanks to the dread for the roots green
Whole body is amped I must contain or appear
I might throw the peace at kids, go to rest and wake up goin
For days I get set off, I ain't got NO way of knowin
How could you fool a ruler? You still smokin wooler?
The first round pick, why'd The Knicks trade Rod Strick?
That man is nice! 
You make acts to make tracks, I'm tired of frontin to em
Gonna step to em, tell 'em they whole shit is dead
I'd rather tell em now, instead of fuckin with they head
Tired of frontin' on 'em, it's like that huh
True indeed God y'knahmsayin, ain't no use frontin
Word to mother
Well don't look at things from the surface
A book without understanding is worthless
120 gave me plenty to chew on
Planted a seed and it grew 
On to the road where we got shit sewed
When crackin shells, and gettin to the ?
I rest in
Na Ru
but
don't take me for a joke
I got an automatic tool.. don't make it have to smoke
Cause yo I'll bust off, In God We Trust, I'm not soft
When I'm droppin it, I'm just the opposite
Now that's hard
Study lesson about
Farad and Elijah
Won't surprise you to be told
we're God
Of the Universe, so when U.N.I.Verse
We gain a better understanding
We're to the cream, risin to the top like my Nubian team
And we don't stop!
Brand Nubian rock the set! [Refrain : Brasco &

Blind to the ways of mankind
God is smiling on you but He's frowning too
Because only God knows what you'll go through, uhh
A child is born with no state of mind
Blind to the ways of mankind
God is smiling on you but He's frowning too
He grew up in an instant, the fourth of seven children
The oldest male on the block was half and half
Brown stones to neck bones, crack jonez to tones
Where young girls spread out and drop seeds like they're farmers
They're old as their momma's, the same age as their aunt
And the neighbourhood drunk men
And that lady with the dreaded disease is like hard to please
And the house of ill fate with the metal gate
Keep the thin people cracked out like munchkin monks
The ole man with the fruit stand is on his man
His hand, his ole heart just can't stand
The CPR as they load him in the back of a car
I'm on a world tour to help free the poor
]From the local drug cats to kids in front of the store
Number runners, gangbangers and the big money spenders
Reality check rings as we descend from the king
Now a child is born with no state of mind
Blind to the ways of mankind

Because only God knows what you'll go through

The home's filled with horror in my horoscope
Tomorrow I could be broke, this ain't a joke
I'm twenty dollars away from bein dead ass
I'm bout to spend half on a bag to get my head blast
Last week I lost to justice cypher born
And spawned a riff with my wiz
Now she dead with my kids
I live by the subway, niggas push drugs in my hallway
All day everyday tryin to get the pay
And I be tryin ta find a better way
You see, when you're poor then you're forced to adore to raw play
Survival be a forte, lookin forward to-a robble up your food stamps
Projects' like boot camps
Wit generals cookin chemical warfare
Ki's to a mayor, I ain't seen ya ass in four years
The law bears down on anybody that's brown
My complexion puts me in the direction of the section 8
Rejection seems to be my fate
As a kid, don't wanna ship my momma, always said I had to wait
And it's been drama up to date
Enough to traumatise people's lives and the eyes they try to fixate
A child is born with no state of mind
Blind to the ways of mankind
God is smiling on you but He's frowning too
Because only God knows what you'll go through
A child is born with no state of mind
Blind to the ways of mankind
God is smiling on you but He's frowning too
Because...
Born into existance with some resistance
A struggle comin out my
ol' earth's womb
It was little past noon,
three months before June
I had a feelin I was headed toward the land of doom
I came out and the doctor got ready to smack
I grabbed the 'bilical cord and tried to pull myself back
But it was too late for that cos in fact
I'll slit the sack so I gotta maintain where I'm at
Now I'm here breathin this diff'rent kind of air
Poverty bound, headed for the welfare
Drug-infested, rat-infested, people drownin in sorrow at neighbourhood bars
Roaches bigger than my hot wheel cars
Dope fiends with swollen arms lookin like rotten wood
Turn to crack monsters up and down the neighbourhood
Liquor store business soar as the crowd pour
Or thru the corridors, echoin off the project walls
That's why the Gods say
A child is born with no state of mind
Blind to the ways of mankind
God is smiling on you but He's frowning too
Because only God knows what you'll go through, uhh
A child is born with no state of mind
Blind to the ways of mankind

Ha, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yo, straight from the wilds of The Bronx, it's Buckwild, y'knowI'msayin?
And that kid Sadat X born king, doin my thing
KnowI'msayin? I let'cha know how it is in my lifestyle everyday
Verse One: Sadat X
Lately yo, I been walkin tightropes
It's an adventure everyday as I walk down the block
Quiet baldhead is like a bad motherfucker
All charged up from Madison Ave
I'm up on the stage if you read the front page
Give me the ol' school mic wiv a cord
I'll stand on the table, give a fuck about a label
Now, we all can't brawl, we all can't brawl
It'll be your downfall when you're goin like this
Is it the cash or the hash from my stash that compells you?
Gas kids throw me but my crew bring me back
They stay on my back so I don't act like alladat
Hook: Busta Rhymes
Now all these niggas carry on like they think they alladat
They think they alladat, they think they alladat
Now all these niggas carry on when they think they alladat
They think they alladat, they think they alladat
Verse Two: Sadat X
Late one night, 55th outpost
Chickenhead watchin to see who she can catch
She got a man, I can tell cos the action in her eyes
Ain't nervous, a young sassy thing
She call me a playa, standin on the corner wiv her whole dime crew
I'm ridin down the block wiv her girlfriend
In the next nigga's car, lookin like a star
Shades, blackness, packed his whole damn frame
Ya got to be down to *?starts?* about the booty
Cos Sonny Lamb packs the wham
It's all good, yeah it's all good
See it attracts kids that are sweater
A nigga like me'll be the first to forgetta
So now she all mad, bringin drama to the crib
Go ahead, chickenhead, wit the funk
You get played like trash if you act like you'd always have and you always
Will
Chickenheads is only good for a thrill
Hook: Busta Rhymes
Yo yo, yo they think they alladat, they think they alladat
All these bitches carry on when they think they alladat
They think they alladat, they think they alladat
Verse Three: Sadat X
Now my cheques jam and I waited all damn week
And if I flip em the bad guy, you wonder why
When the corner officers and nobody can call me back
And everybody claims to know nothin
And these is the peoples that's down wit me
Supposedly, lays on my side, yeah right
They let a nigga die in the night if you let em
You can get wild, flip, go grab the mask
But it damn sure slow-up the cash cos I know
Ya be a menace to society, still waitin for the dough
The thinkin man is the one with the plan
Plant his seeds first then be ready to burst
It's like that, huh? My name is X from the hot blocks of Harlem
Take it personally when you try to stop my stardom
Use to be mild, find myself gettin wild
Got to slow down for my girl and my child
Cos I love life and I gots ta live it
And everytime I get on stage I'ma move sometin
And you can never say the X didn't hit'cha
Aiyo, I put it on ya, but first I warn ya
This ain't no average skit, this is a hit
More than you hit, better than your best shit
Better than your man's shit, better than his cousin's shit
Better than your whole block, buck once and then ya come wit that nons....
Interlude: Sadat X talking
Aight, hey Buck, when you bring what you bring to the game and when I bring
What I bring to the game, it's dangerous that I can't even call it. But we
Gonna end it off like this, y'knowI'msayin? On some Bronx town shit, check
It out
Verse Four: Sadat X
The big X has spoken, courtesy of Buck
A Bronx hoe-down similar to the showdown
Won't you place a bet on ya man
You know my style and you know where I stand
I'ma leave you on wit the real for right now
Peace to Brand Nubian, Now Rule and Buckwild
But right now, peep the master of the headnod
Hit New York harder and smarter, thieves attack, now stay back
Tainted styles don't pass the grade
A lotta kids are slidin, just ridin on the wave
A lotta kids are slidin, just ridin on the wave
A lotta kids are slidin, just ridin on the wave
Hook: Busta Rhymes
Yo, all these niggas think they hard when they think they alladat
They think they alladat, they think they alladat
All these bitches act like sluts when they think they alladat
They think they alladat, they think they alladat
Now all these fraud niggas are bitches when they think they alladat
They think they alladat, they think they alladat
Fuck dem niggas out there who think they alladat
They think they alladat, they thunk they alladat
Fuck dem niggas, fuck dem bitches
Fuck dem fraud ass, motherfuckers
Fake ass niggas
HAH!Somebody went gold in the Billboard, it was a X, but it was Mia
Young boys ran to me in the local pizzeria
He said,  "You Jamar and Haji man y'all hot to death
Can y'all save what's left, or at least make a claim?"
Shorty remind me of myself when I started in this game
And through years I'm basically the same, as are my brothers
I'm the eight track flashback before the days of crack
Is it real or an act, fuck it, let's save the kids
Yeah you all about war, why you tryin to die for?
Yeah them niggas real raw but you sleepin on the floor
Yeah I walk through the Valley with my man Spark and Allie
Days of money, in Harlem Week '85
With the Captain's hats, and my father's old guns
Before I had a daughter, and before they had sons
I stay the hypnotizer, style's a tranquilizer
Got you feelin all loose, wettin up the goose
The great Datty X and I'm hear to say
You can always find me around the way
Uhh, I be that kid with the dreads that remember
When I hid from the Feds, plus I always did what I said
I was gonna do, talk shit, right in front of you
Never forfeit, on top, we do it non stop
Remember when we let the bomb drop
With more jewels than a pawn shop from the school
Of the hard knocks, straight off the Now Rule block
Powerful aftershocks with the strength of Master locks
We got you in a paradox, between a rock and a hard place
We got the hard bass
And erybody's gon' get a taste, get your plate
First we had to let it marinate, now we straight, uhh
Five mics is how we rate, stand with us
And stand amongst the likes of the great scandalous
Cats, try they best to decipher the tape
What we manifest still gets blessed in every state
Hey listen here dog a nigga keep it spicy hot
Rhyme flow stay straighter than six o'clock
Hustle rhymes like a nigga hustle shit on the block
The shit is work and got a 4.6 in the lot
I hustle knowledge, charge tuition like a college
My wisdom hold me down in town like Jackie Brown
I teach _Dangerous Minds_, like that chick Michelle Pfeffeir
That's why the Gods check got at least 6 cypher
My Justice Cypher Born, I ain't no helpless type nigga
Like a gat without a trigga I got the figure to make figures
For years I've been doin this thing I do
Since Ralph McDaniel's video show was on channel U
Station 31, vice grip channel changer son
The show was the banger, came in clear with a hanger
Top notch status watch the God get it flamin
Herbal with the verbal, drop top twin turbo
Blazin for the year, born build to 2 G's
Flow like these, help the God stack cheese
Summer Jet-Ski, trunk with TV's
Sittin under tropic trees with iced teas
Mind stay positive black, guaranteed
To grab the top dollar, more pull than the RottweilerPeace to the God
Peace Allah
Aiyyo there go that brother Grand Puba
I heard that brother got knowledge of self
Yo true indeed brother
Yo let's have that brother come over and add on to the cipher
"Sunshine, everybody loves the sunshine"
"Folks get down in the sunshine!"
"Everybody loves the sunshine!"
"My life, my life, my life, my life"
Aiyyo knowledge this
The attribute Haji helper to another God
In need He Allah God Islam
As I proceed to civilize the uncivilized
Word of wisdom to the groove from the wise 
I guess I'm like the Verbalizer for the fact I'm movin' Blackwards
This Asiatic Black man is a dog spelled backwards
The maker, the owner, the cream of the planet Earth
Father of civilization, God of the universe
Manifestin' thought with my infinite styles
Making sure this travels, twenty-three million miles
The other six, I set the crucifix
Because the heart of the problem is this 
Preacher got my Old Earth, puttin' money in the pan
For the rest of the week, now I'm eatin' out a soup can
He has a home, drives his Caddy through town
Has my old earth believin' that he's comin' from the ground 
Slain are those who fought for what was right
Slayed are those who fell victim to the bite
A drug controlled substance, contained in a vial
Set up by the devil as he looks and he smiles
Good at the game of tricknology
But I have knowledge of myself, you're not foolin' me
You see, the answer to me is Black unity
Unification to help our bad situation
I wrote this on a day of wisdom power
All bein' born to myself 
I won't diss the next brother to be paid, that's not my trade
It's just the plan that is designed by the colored man
Now our babies are born to think this is the way of us 
That's the way the devil wants it, so it is no fuss 
It's just that sad old song self-destruction
To stop our reproduction
There put our wisdom before us 
That makes it wisdom knowledge 
But we need knowledge wisdom
To bring forth the understanding 
Culture freedom 
Power refinement 
Equality God Build Destroy Born's Our Cipher 
 No, not nowadays bro
Whitey put self, portrayed in many interpretations
Sayin' that we'd receive more gold for our labor in his nation
 God, Now Cypher
It's time to drop the bomb and make the devil pay the piper
 What?
 What?
"Sunshine"
Wake up, wake up, wake up!
"Everybody loves the sunshine! .. " Wake up, wake up, wake up!
"Folks get down in the sunshine! .." Wake up, wake up, wake up!
"Everybody loves the sunshine!"
"My life, my life, my life, MY LIFE"
The solution -- knowledge of self to better our self
Cause I know myself, that we can live much better than this
Nothing's changed, it's just another sequel
The devil's still causin' trouble amongst the righteous people
Drugs in our community 
Can't even get a job 
Poisoning our babies 
Lyin' who is God 
Well here's some food for thought, many fought for the sport
And the black man still comes up short?
It's time to motivate, build and elevate
Blind deaf and dumb we've gotta change their mind state
So I dip dip diver, civilize a 85er
Gotta let him know the devil's a conniver
This is the plan from the brother man
From the motherland now it's time to take a stand
I keep strivin' to do my duty to awake em
To the universal family I say asalaam alaikum
Yeah..
Now I'ma do like this
Nuff respects to the Brother Jazzy Jay, nuff respect
Nuff respects, to my Brand Nubian brothers
Bust it
Lord Jamar, God Allah
Derek X is on the flex
Alamo is good to go
Sincere, the God is in here
So move on black man, move on
We gotta move on black man, move on
Move on black man, move on
We gotta move on black man, move on
Now before I motivate I'ma just say like this
Please.. educate Allah's children, with equality
Move on black man, move on
You gotta move on black man, move on *2X*Once again it's the dread and the bald head
Won't be satisfied til the devil's I see em all dead
Layin in a mass grave, for the past slaves they were stayin
Do you think a nigga forgot? Matter fact
My trigger's hot, you blink you gettin shot
And if the weather's hot, your body's gonna stink when it rot
Lord J got the arms, Sadat got the bombs
We don't feel shit, you cried a hit on ya moms
Now leave the bloody bitch in a ditch
Get'cha pretty penny if the mother of my enemy
My brother's sendin me four bursts from down south
And for the lies you told, I'ma buck you in the mouth
Now what the fuck's this all about?
Everybody gotta weapon
Who's gonna let burst the first shot? Hmm, I thought not
Feel the battle, tell Darryl that his first-born is dead
Shot in the back by the task force
I'm mistakin your face in a similar face
Got em murdered
Much like how the buffalo is herded by the pale face
Who threw some game on the Indian, who got jerked for New York
You better walk, got caught then wear your vest
We might throw somethin that's hollow
Brand Nubian ain't never been the ones, to follow nobody
We gotta lotta arms but I like to pump the shotty
Hook: 
Now what the fuck's this all about?
It's all about brothers risin up, wisin up
Sizin up a situation, but gettin fit within the nation
No deviation, a straight pathways down my wrath
I sing sounds of math on behalf
Of the Gods and the Earths, birthplace in space
You be fuckin with my turf when you be fuckin with my race
Now face, your maker and take your last breath
The time is half past death
Now what the fuck's this all about?
If you're less than a man, in my eyes
Then your head's off, and I'ma set off the wheels
Motherfuck the baby seals or savin the whales
All the crack sells, it's the armageddon
............... so cancel the wettin
Go in the garage, find that old camouflage
Blend in like a mirage and explode
Take nothin lightly, crackers shootin nightly
Cos I don't need nobody that's gon' shoot me in the back
Black people show 'n' act and when they front, that's wack

 The airport staff at LaGuardia knows

I kick the visit, in Richmond, lost in Boston
Benz in Houston, two hours away from Austin
 TEXAS, where you don't see no Lexus
Just low cars that bounce
 And Taco Bells by the ounce
 Speakin of food, yo Sincere you made it clear
We need our meals kosher on this flight
Don't want no swine in my sight
 Aiyyo God, everything's straight
The kid's sendin a limo, to meet us at the gate
 Word that's cool, youknowhatI'msayin?

With knockin out trips like at six hour clips
Up in the Cali in the mornin groundstandin

Major in History 
I would think it's plain to see
 We come in the name of G-O-D, GIRLS

Intro/Chorus:
You don't have to drive a fancy car
Just for you to be a shinin' star
No matter who you are, no matter who you are
Uhh, now it started it off for me in apartment 6C
Project style, ate government cheese for a while
Pop Duke wasn't there cos he had to do a bid
So momma love stuck with these bad ass kids
She used to say keep your head up, always think positive
And never be ashamed of who you are or where you live
Teenage years I had to struggle doing that
Shorty say "Don't talk to him, girlfriend, look where he live at
Crib probably crawlin with roaches and rats
Plus cats be in his hallways with the drugs and the gats"
I used to try and honeys used to walk on by
Now I'm damn near 20 and still ain't got no ride
Caught a record deal, now them same old chicks that used to walk on by
Go out their way to say hi
But they gets none
That's why I'm with the same girl from the same projects that I come from
Because.......
Chorus 
Well this is that time that you've waited for
Three linked from what was said to be extinct
You say take my weed-smellin ass home, I'm grown
More thirst than if I swallowed sand bags
Not fiending enough to go out and grab bags from women
I swear if we don't hear this on the air
I'll be down at the station
Your broadcast from Monday has now been switched to no day
With the class team that I'm with, we stay fit
Just like the calm before the twister hit
Brand Nubian name is gonna blister shit
We raise the flags in three places
Employ black faces from midnight blacks to light tan
Brand Nubian straight rate policy for the world
For your little man, for your little girl, from Cheryl to Earl
Watch how it all go down and unfurl
Mark this print, I feel like we've all been sent
It's more than gettin money and gettin bent
No matter who you are, no matter who you are
Chorus
Brand Nubian cats spread
A four-letter word seldom heard amongst my nation
Understandings highest elevation, the foundation
Of creation of motivation, in my family there's no relation
They got us willing to be killing off our population, full-time occupation
We need to turn it around like oscillation
Or watch it all burn to the ground from frustration
Lord Jamar, I'mma show love to all my people who show
To me that's how it's gotta be
Peace to Prodigy and Mobb Deep
God's working hard on the streets for the love of the peeps
Niggas bring their ass in the clubs every week
Walk right past the brothers and they can't speak
All hands meet to shake, for Pete's sake
Let's break the ice, life livin love, love livin life 
Chorus Yeah 
Yo this goes out 
To all the ghettos around the world 
If you strugglin 
And your surroundings are shitty 
It's a good chance that's where you live
Still livin in the ghetto
After all this time, through all the climb
Still livin in the ghetto
Don't let it take your mind
{"raised in the ghetto singin songs called survival"}
Yo I was born here, my momma was born here
Her momma was born here, my father was born here
And his father was born here, and we all here, livin in fear
My peers are either dead or in prison for years
How many generations, get caught, in a perpetuation
Of poverty, robbery becomes a occupation
Look around, it's pure desolation
And desperation, feel the sweat, from the persperation
See it's hot in hell's kitchen, a lot fell victim
Everyday we in a fight, how can we beat the system?
All this time got out mind conditioned
We find solace in religion, Muslim or Christian
We bow down on our knees and hope somebody listenin
But all we promised for narcotics is a drug conviction
Every day is like Russian roulette
It's the next century and we ain't got shit yet y'all
Uhh, when will it go away, when will there be a day
That we all got paper just to throw away
When will the tables turn, when will the devils burn
When will the time come when seeds be the main concern
A hungry man is a angry man
Gotta freak some type of plan to get some {?} up in the hands
See life is like a hustle and it's colder than a whore's heart
But when you comin from the ghetto that's a rough start
By the time you 12, you know the street life very well
Stuck in hell, neighborhoods are one big holdin cell
The hood life nevertheless been a good life
But should life constantly consist of stress and strife
They don't play us, cause they know we represent peace
And they don't no peace, they want us killin with a piece
Or up North with some grease, with a photograph of some peeps
Just lettin us slug it out, 'til we all become deceased
Jean the dopefiend who keep all her cars clean
And Mr. Mack who smoke cracks on the weekend
That music upstairs is comin from the Puerto Ricans
Arabs sellin guns in the store
Nigerians pump the diesel yo, that's so raw
Cornerbound Dominicans play the block in the daytime
With names like Jose, Plantano, or Reyes
Me and you grow or as a result stay as, a
Victim of block day, an hour earlier
He fought with his fists now the nigga layin twisted
Swirlin smoke your girl and coke and guns
The Sherling coat, that you bought for you and your suns
Can be replaced, but you could get laced
Oh they hit him in the face, it was awful, terrible for his family
To see him laid like that, said he was comin right back
It was fast, seen the fire, heard the blast
 - 2XBust it, Brand Nubian!
Who calls you into work? 
Who ??? on your day off? 
Well who gives you your pay? 
And who takes it away? 
You mean to tell me that you're still not a slave
In the land of the free and the home of the brave?
Hmmmm
Knowledge cipher, divided by powers equals wisdom
But to know we have to start with knowledge first
Divine evils will disperse in a hearse situation
Now we hear some people sayin that we curse
The lack of the knowledge of our self makes it worse
Science that we're droppin make the average head burst
I'm not an advocate of war, but if the colored man is gonna be on
Well I gots to be on too
And if he wants to drop a bomb I'm a drop you, word
With the gods takin back what's mine
Colored man this is the end of the line
The train ride is over now we stuck in the station
90s is the year, New York's the plantation
Should I call you master? You better run faster
I'll put your head in plaster, I'm the new overseer
You label me a primate, ape or gorilla
... but watch gorilla turn to killer
The Asiatic king but minus crazy rings
The universal god is the true and livin god
Sadat X, one of the last remainin thinkers
Come into my room and I can show you where I tinkers
With rhymes, so build the 1990 mottos
It fills my times instead of fillin bottles of cracks
And committin vile acts mostly against blacks
And you don't stop, bust it
The 1990 movement's for the black man's improvement
Now it's time to get the knowledge of your self
As I walk down the street I see the gods and cipher born
So I listen and observe the gods the seer make some getters
It's the black man's timing and righteous man's year
I'm overwhelmed, another god steps to the helming to teach us
The black man should practice what he preaches
Or at least try to live a fruitful life
Or lie peace and get some livin trife
I had a brother say I'll wash the clothes and cook the food
I'll pay your rent, now this is how the story went
Emphatically no, singin singin that weak wisdom knowledge shit
Hajji god is here to cancel  it
So just ring the alarm, another devil is dying, whoa-ee
Just ring the alarm an uncle tom is trying, whoa-ee
I didn't come to conceal it, I come to reveal it
The true and livin god was the son of man
And if you ever need assistance just take my hand
Now my great great grand was hung up on a tree
By the colored man, you probably know him as a white man
I seen the Oprah Winfrey show, she said that was in the past
Well bitch, kiss my ass
Now it's time to teach the people
Why our peoples not treated equal, now here's the next sequel
I stand taller than the tallest wall... ya ever saw
Sincere, gave the god a call, we boost to fund em all
Long as he's a devil I'm a take it
If a devil catch me right I'll leave em butt naked
I say peace to the god, when I get hype it cause adrenaline
See we love the sun cause we don't lack melanin
Ask me do I hate a devil? Take a guess
... hope you said yes
Well Lord Jamar take nothin' on face value
You only know what the devil wants you to know
They started keep us apart from our social equality
Which cause inequality
He don't want us to know his biz or how filthy he is
And all his 
So in his court the unawares habit
But I report cause I won't
Don't look at things from the surface
A book without understanding is worthless
120 gave me plenty to chew on
Planted a seed and it grew
On to the road where we got shit
So we crackin shells and gettin to the yolk
I rest in the
Rule
but don't take me for a joke
I got an automatic tool
Don't make it have to smoke
Cause yo I bust off, in god we trust, I'm not soft
When I'm droppin it I'm just an opposite
Now that's hard...
I study lessons about the rod and Elijah
Won't sup-posit and tell you we're god
... of the universe
And when you and I verse we gain a better understandin
Which is the cream risin to the top like my Nubian team
And we don't stopSteven Biko, D.O. from the Bronx, Medgar Evers

{*rocket soars overhead*}
"Fire in the hole!"
{*war sounds*}
Hut one, hut two, hut
Hut three, hut four, hut
Soldiers don't die they just fade away
Have you ever tried to spray the AK
We camoflauged down with the analog sound
Leavin enemies in the ground
A thin red line, between war and peace
Sometimes we creep on all fours behind enemy lines
We look death in the face, on a daily basis
We do it cause we have to, a soldier's story
Aiyyo taste the blood, as it hit your face
And walk through the mud, shit up to your waist
Feel the mosquito bite, at night, when the torpedos hit
Smell the burnin flesh, hear the screams of death
My man Jim just lost a limb
His right arm was the price, freedom cost to him
So much, loss of life, we lost so many men
So many horrors, I wouldn't know, where to begin
In a foxhole, lock and load let's rock'n'roll
Guerilla warfare, all's fair that ends fair
We gotta take this bridge, for the sake of the kids
For the way, that they make us live
We can do it with the gat or hand to hand combat
Make plans to bomb that
You see, war is hell so much more to tell
And this is for alla y'all soldiers that fell
Yo left, yo left
Yo left, right, left
I got 13 guns now, plus a sword; bullets all over the floor
In the drawer, by the closet, in the door
And Ben, fixed my firing pen, that's 14
Hear a 30 bark, shoot it at the dirty narc
Spark came with this gun, makin it 15
Oh yeah that ol' 22'll make it 16
Who got dough for the VA trip, come back with two on the hip
That's 18, shiny and clean
Jean the dopefiend been holdin somethin mean
My son Sammy hold the diesel, and you give him the weasel
2 more flips, guns with grips, I'm into whips
I'm 60/40 and the Bronx is no shorts
We build forts from {?} and tenements
Shoot off the roof blow-joe, and light a {?}
My niggas hold the heat and leave you dead on my street
Oh we gon' eat, and anybody in my path is gettin beat
Me and my soldiers commit espionage, for that 3-car garage
Livin large, with the swimmin pool in the back yard
Traitors, infiltrators of that top secret data
Exterminators of creators who invented haters
Cause there's a civil war, poor killin poor
Usin that psychological warfare to kill us all
Too severe to ignore, so I play the spook who sat by the door
Righteous teacher for the poor
Dedicated soldiers, freedom fighters
Rhyme writers on chore with the cure to stop the undyin war
Nubian, follow me, hup two three
From the year 2000 to the E-N-D
Cause I don't know what y'all been told
Brand Nubian never sells their souls
Yo left, yo left
Yo left, right, left
Hut one, hut two, hut
Hut three, hut four, hut["Some get over the hump... bootleggin!

Verse One: Sadat X
I've been watching you for about two weeks
Selling phony imitations of myself
If I chose to wild I might flip or break your table
Strong arms tappin all your pockets
Look, look at this tape, loose ass plastic
Copy machine picture damn straight I'm gonna hit ya
But I don't cause I maintain, you're just a common street peddler
A vendor, the question revolves:
Is the record company involved?
Hmm, if the reality is that I'm bein played
Should somebody take the weight cause my pocket's like on E
That I can't see, therefore I burnt teeth
When I find the source to my loss of income
I gots ta see him Jack, yo I gots ta see
And the street vendor out there, don't steal don't sell my tape
I don't give a fuck about the plea that you coppin'
Everyone's got problems sellin my tape ain't gonna solve em
Though it might add.... holdin your eye with a heatin pad
Dig the scene cat, knowledge the crime, know the time
Or you'll be out much more than a dime

Verse Two: Lord Jamar
A kick in the ass from a leg and a boot
Constitute the right to shoot one who steals my loot
Bang bang like it ain't no thing to the bastard
Who sold my shit before it's mastered
Now how the fuck did you get a copy?
It's an inside job or the security is sloppy
But nevertheless I'm doin my best to solve this mess
I find out, I blow a hole in his chest
It's black music that they wanna discredit
Garth Brooks ain't bootlegged cause they'd never let it
Happen, that's why I'm cappin and slappin
All the motherfuckers sellin tapes of young black kids rappin
They try to say hardcore don't sell
But everywhere I go they kick my shit well
New York to California everywhere in between
Know the flavor of the God so what the fuck do you mean?
I gotta get my props in ninety-two it's up to you
The listener to do your part and buy that bullshit from the start
I can't give back what I don't receive
Best believe they got a trick up they sleeve
["Too much bootleggin!  Too much bootleggin is goin on!
Too much bootleggin!  Too much bootleggin is goin on
Too much bootleggin!  Too much bootleggin is goin on!
Too much bootleggin!  Too much bootleggin is goin on."]Bosse dans l'ombre, vie en autarcie

Mad people over here keep losing they jobs
Half the hood in the ground, and the rest behind bars
We want the money, the ice, the crib and the cars
Yo, the sky's the limit, so reach for the stars
But be careful of the choices you make, watch the snakes
Know who keep it real and who keep it real fake
And if you ever fall, you find out who's your friend
You got to brush the dirt off then you get back up again
Uh, and then you get back up
And when you back up on your game, watch them pop back up

Aiyo, why you looking so sad, it's not that bad
Things could be worse, you could have a toe-tag
So wipe away your tears, and just be glad you're here
You had worse things in life that you had to bare
A soft spot in my heart, so I had to care
I couldn't stand by, watch a grown man cry
So I offer my condolence, and told him
To stand on his feet and walk to his destiny
I'm never gonna let these muthafuckas get the best of me
Addressing me, put up a fight or, put up your life
Put up or shut up, when you put up a price
I'm not a gambling man, so I put up the dice
I like control in the odds and, holding the cards
They brought drugs to the hood and they got sold to the Gods
But still through it all, we refuse to submit
And that's why we choose to spit real shit, like
Time stand still on a day that's slow
Bills piled up on the living room floor
Hard to work it out when it's only just me
Even with the glasses, feel like I can't see
Some days on my budget, I can't even cop trees
They trying to break the God, and bring you down to my knees
Combined with these is the fact that my daughter's far away
That's why I speak to her daily so I know that she's ok
But don't pity on your boy, cuz I be aight
But everything come to light, and everyday'll be bright
And ya mind and your body is solved
And the problems won't seem to harm in your mental
And A.S.P.'s in your residential, that's the cause
Of celebrating, where the babies could grow
And you ain't gotta lock your doors, told to
Elimination of wars, where the diseases of the world is just a bygone
Some day, we'll put it together and we'll get it all done
Some day, your head is much wider
Some day, we'll walk in the wings of a beautiful sun
Some day, then the rays is much brighterAh yeah, ya know what I'm sayin'
Nine trey, Brand Nubian in effect
On ya motherfuckin' head
Not givin' a fuck
Word up, know what I'm sayin'
In the wilderness of North America
You like to taste the lead, well get ya face fed
After I'm done, you rather suck on pencils
Here comes the coroner with chalk for the stencils of your body
As I walk over the shit and spit outta heart
Now brothers talk shit and can't back it
That's why I had to fit em' for a full metal jacket
Peel his cap once cause I know it's all it takes
Watch the motherfucker fall and his body catch the shakes 
Just before he die, I'mma look him in his eye
Ask the nigga how he figure he was big enough to try
The motherfuckin' G to the O to the D
I told ya couple times that the Gods must be crazy
But ya didn't listen, so now ya on a mission
To get an autopsy, a raw C-O, ya can't stops me
Now tell me is there anybody else
Before I put my AK back up on the shelf
Cause I put in work like Job Corps
Niggas talk shit and get jerked and robbed for
Their life by a knife or a gun
So when ya see me comin, nigga run
See I had to lick em' - Punk motherfucker
See I had to lick em' - Punk motherfucker

A lot of kids is wondering, or hoping that I fell
You are here to talk and I'm here to fucking walk
Let me ask a little something, I let my track record float

Together on the joint was a definite power move

Well punk motherfuckers try to flex on the G-O-D
But like I said yo the Gods must be crazy
So it don't phase me or my gat
Just put up your thangs and then we start to slang joints
Scoring points like a Genesis
Everybody down with my crew are fucking menaces
To society, cause society failed to embrace the black male variety
So that's why we're so damn hostile
Beat a motherfucker down like he was a stepchild
Break him up in the ribs with the knuckles of brass
Take off my belt and then I buckle your ass
You say you've never ran but we'll have you running fast
Lord Jamal is quick to blast when
Punks jump up to get beat down!
Step up, step up and catch a bad one "Cause no matter who you are, you'll still catch a bullet scar"
You like the taste of lead, well get your face fed
After I'm done, you rather suck on pencils
Here comes the coroner with chalk for the stencils of your body
As I walk over the shit and spit outta hock
Now brothers talk shit and can't back it
That's why I had to fit em with a full metal jacket
Peel his cap once cause I know it's all it takes
Watch the muthaphucka bawlin, his body catch the shakes 
Just before he die, I'mma look him in his eye
Ask the nigga how he figure he was big enough to try
The muthaphuckin G-to the O-to the D
I told ya couple times that the Gods must be crazy
But ya didn't listen, so now ya on a mission
To get an autopsy, a raw C-O, ya can't stops me
Now tell me is there anybody else
Before I put my AK back on the shelf
Cos I put in work like Job Corps
Niggas talk shit and get jerked and robbed for
Their life by a knife or a gun
So when ya see me comin, nigga, run
"See I had to lick em" "Punk muthaphucka"
"See I had to lick em" "Punk muthaphucka"
"See I had to lick em" "Punk muthaphucka"
"See I had to lick em" "Punk muthaphucka"
"Cause no matter who you are, you'll still catch a bullet scar"
*repeat*
Somebody's dead, a whole crowd formed
The cops ain't even come yet, Money's dead in the street
Somebody called his people and they come downstairs screamin
Six girls cryin wild cos Money had a child
A good dick, couldn't even stand the .44 lick
Dead quick, the funeral is strictly closed-casket
And ol' Aunt Faith, her baby fingerpaints
My Moms know the time so she wanna send me down to Alabama
I gotta cousin, says she's got some friends
She says they strictly fuckin, I could get away from buckin
She tried to gas me up, I tell her sex is everywhere
And sex is but a word, it ain't shit I ain't heard
Tell my Moms I ain't leavin, my crew said to stay
My crew I'm believin so fuck it anyway
I got my mob from the Rule, that live by the cruel
And my crew from Courtland Ave. always say they'll set it off
And if I choose, who's somebody might die
And if they don't die, they won't be able to walk
Pump slugs in his back, he's talkin pussy talk
"Cause no matter who you are, you'll still catch a bullet scar"
"See I had to lick em" "Punk muthaphucka"
"See I had to lick em" "Punk muthaphucka"
"See I had to lick em" "Punk muthaphucka"
"See I had to lick em" "Punk muthaphucka"
"Cause no matter who you are, you'll still catch a bullet scar"
*repeat*
Well hey muthaphuckaz, it's the dread with the 9
Lead to the head of you devils, now it's bedtime
I said I'm not the nigga to be playin out
I'll leave your body layin out the sid, talk shit and you'll get licked
Get hit by a dread who's fed with the nonsense
Leave you red, where my clip empty out his contents
Spill your guts when I fill ya up with the flame juice
Niggas' nuts, I had to fuck em up and use my name loose
Some silly goose, we be down on the subway
He gets no love cos he's rubbin me the wrong way
Disrespectin, infect the masses
So I elect to come direct and dissect some asses
My nigga passes the gat, rat-a-tat-tat
Now you shut your fuckin trap cos you was who I was buckin at
I got you suckin at the chrome like a nipple
The only way your ass is goin home is as a cripple
And then I peed on niggas, came the absolute worst
Lost compassion for humans, and then smack up they moms
Ran and got the arms, from under the mattress
My little man Satan got somethin in his jacket
Let me get to work and I'll release the swarm
My name mean a lot these days
I got the hash, cash plus my people raise me well
Bring it to em X, and we'll take the weight
Run and get the Mac from the Park Ave. location
Bronx location, wit a extra bag of clips
Plus I want it tight and I don't play that much
So I'll have all the reefer and set up all the stock
And everybody's fuckin, yo Money, she wasn't great
You just got mad, ya girl got videotape
So save the noise, niggas, cos I can't hear
"Cause no matter who you are, you'll still catch a bullet scar"
"See I had to lick em" "Punk muthaphucka"
"See I had to lick em" "Punk muthaphucka"
"See I had to lick em" "Punk muthaphucka"
"See I had to lick em" "Punk muthaphucka"
"Cause no matter who you are, you'll still catch a bullet scar"
*repeat x3*Intro/Chorus: Laura Alfored
Seem all the fellas understand what it feel
Cos it's a Nubian Jam and everthing's real
*repeat*
Verse One: Lord Jamar
It's time to blow up the spot, anything you was in, you're thru the roof
All the jams we done been thru is proof
We blend truth, with mathematics doin acrobatics over beats
The sound dramatic when it played in Landrover jeeps
I know my peeps is in the front of the stage
Smokin blunts with the strokin stunts, ready to set it
When the word is given, I know you heard how we was livin
Never takin no shit, just stayin clever and makin the hits
Shakin the tits of the honeys when they jump
Makin money's what we bump cos slumps is for chumps
And we pumps, worldwide, girls slide backstage
Lookin for a free ride, legs divide at a young age
Lord Jamar is like Jesus, speakin in parables
And to devils it's unbearable
To see this, but they ain't got no choice
No escapin the penetration of the voice
Chorus 
Verse Two: Sadat X
And I watched and I watched and I watched then I looked
The X is like no other who can drop it in the rain
I'm not that high, so give me back my lighter
Stage right in the party at night, I'm in the shadows
Thinkin bout returnin to the spotlight
The X is top flight, ESPN highlight
From, throughout the rhythm, I give em what I give em
Oil slickness on that ass like *?Ewin?*
I know what I'm doin, leave your whole town ruined
Brand Nubian, the name alone stands
Overseas fans be shoutin different accents
So hence the black prince from 2-0
Soft-spoken but my words comprehended by the herds
Goin back to the days past the ol' gun phase
All stare in amaze or get caught with the rays
Cos the X is like the master of the phrase.....
Chorus: Laura Alfored
Seem all the fellas understand what you feel
Cos it's a Nubian Jam and everthing's real
*repeat x3*
Verse Three: Sadat X, Lord Jamar
I want the mic in the clutch
Cos it's too cold to hold, and too hot to touch
I'm like the thoroughbred searchin for cheese
You can't cut off the head of a fatal disease
MC's freeze at thirty-two degrees below
Justice served, now watch us bust this herd
In the head with another jam set by the brother man
Letters for the other man, understand
Chorus: Laura Alfored
Seem all the fellas understand what you feel
Cos it's a Nubian Jam and everthing's real

On aime les histoires et les films les plus hardcores
Mais ma musique, faut que ça tue sa mère
Mais je suis trop vivant et je tue la mort
Ici ça pue la merde, on s'entretue à tort
Alors fais gaffe zinc', on a la rage et y a pas de vaccin
Tu vois le truc ? Analyse et calcule
Deal + weed = thunes, c'est mathématique
J'ai pas fait Maths Sup' mais j'ai capté l'astuce
On est tous dans ce cas-là, tu veux parier là-dessus ?
En bas, on bave devant l'étalage des richesses
Au p'tit écran, la vie des grands c'est les palaces et l'ivresse
Chez nous, c'est chaud, on se demande si on va passer l'hiver
Mais faut bien qu'on amasse les billets, non ? On capitalise
Faut qu'on réalise nos rêves et sans l'oseille, c'est pas réaliste
Tout est bon pour rafler la mise, on joue mais on connait les règles
Ce serait différent si on tenait les rennes mais c'est pas nous qui avons créer le système
Moi je suis réel et si je t'aime, je prie pour toi, je me dis "Pourquoi on se disperse ?"
Pourquoi on s'immerge ?
Le bitume nous absorbe, rare de nous voir sobre, des âmes sombres, on se croit au cimetière
Des gueules d'enterrement, des heures d'entêtement
À chercher l'or pour régler les endettements
Nous, on fait rien en rêvant bêtement
Rêver c'est dormir les yeux grands ouverts
Le bruit du fric est une jolie musique, son chant nous berce
On s'en bouleverse et quand les caisses sont vides
Trop de sang versé quand les frères sont speed
C'est maille ou crève et regarde où ça nous mène, l’État nous perd
Si on s'en sort, c'est grâce à nous-mêmes

Uhh, uh huh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Uh huh, come on, check it out, check it out, what?
Brand Nubian      "I'm black and I'm proud"
Uh, like that, like that, what?
"Say it loud"  "I'm black and I'm proud"
Come on, come on, come on, come on  "Say it loud"
Verse One: Sadat X
We made men in this world, digging for bones
The untraceable ones come with no clones
100 years from now y'all can still get this bomb
On the Brand Nubian dot com
My name should be mentioned with the Portier, not the Gualtier
Although it smell good, I still get mad at Rosewood
A Nubian card member since that faithful December
In the 80 years, from tears to cheers, things we did should be listed in a
Pyramid, studied by a little kid
Talked about by old jacks with slacks
Can I move the black is my first and foremost
Can I get a little land for me and mine?
Grow vegetables, maybe make a little wine
Build with the Gods and the bright sunshine
Before we save others we gotta save our own kind
Chorus:  *variations with Jamar and Puba's shoutouts*
"I'm black and I'm proud"   "Say it loud"    "I'm black and I'm proud"
"Say it loud"  "I'm black and I'm proud"  "Say it loud"   "I'm black and
I'm proud"
"Say it loud"
Verse Two: Lord Jamar
Now did you know it was you who was first to walk the Earth
Gave birth to the Universe, uh
Afflicted with the curse of the slave
Predicted to inherit the earth in the last days
Now as we take you home, what we make our own
It's written in stone like Commandments
Read them every now and then or when you get the chance
Catch a glance through the power lens, see if you could see us advance
G-O-D in the dance, reporting freelance
Fought for a chance, got you hanging by the seat of your pants
Our immediate stance when we came to the game
Was completely advanced so no one sounds the same
7 and one-half ounces of brain
When we around make sure you bow down to the king
Brand Nubian style is how we do our thing
So if you feel good, real good
Scream it out loud if you black and you proud
Chorus
Verse Three: Grand Puba
Feel me now, check my style
A brother's resume run longer than the Nile
Justice cipher born to teach man, woman and child
In the land of the lost where my people went foul
Do the knowledge, black, look at the way that we act
Smoking crack or each other with the gat
The only race of people who kill self like that
I deal with actual facts to keep my mind on track
I love y'all that's why I say these things
Watch me transform chickenheads to queens
Rhymes full of protein like rice and beans
Brand Nubian cats here to change all that
The maker, the owner, the cream of the Earth
Proud to be black because the black man's first
My flow frequency is at a million megahertz
So when I spit my verbals I'm heard around the Universe 
So don't front, say it loud, I'm black and I'm proud
ChorusIntro/Chorus: Lord Jamar, Grand Puba
Straight outta Now Rule, Brand Nu keepin cool
We drop a jewel and never stoppin what we do
Always do what we must, everything that we touch
Is going platinum plus, comin thru in a clutch
*repeat*
Verse One: Lord Jamar, Grand Puba
A lot of y'all niggas is 85th
, on some shady shit
Bark is much worse than your bite like a baby pit
In the pitch dark of the night you's afraid to get exposed
Like the sunlight which rose in the morning
Froze in a gunfight, forcing those who run with you to reevaluate
Affiliations
We salivate from hunger, placed in fucked up situations
And wonder when retaliation will occur
Build destroy H-he or her
It's time to fill the void, niggas kill the noise
To the young boys, you fuckin with a grown-ass man
Watch your tone or get acquainted with the back of my hand
Nubian Brand steadily influencin fans
For other rappers we gon' ruin your plans
What we doin stands as a motto
Like Grace Jones' nipple to the bottle
We pioneer and never follow
We're out for the lion's share now watch me take it there
Yeah, my verbal clarity speaks for my popularity
Sell 5 million CDs and give the proceeds to my favorite charity
Son, I ain't gonna super splash you with no Fantasy Island shit
I mean I work hard for what I got and I be thankful for what I get
And if you practice, spit your verbs properly, not sloppily
Like monopoly, you can end up with cheese, whips and property
Oh damn, silly of me, I forgot to let y'all know
It's one thing you should never do in this game and that's sell your soul
I make a lot of sense then I go and make the dollars
Work hard like blue collars, ghetto scholars is hard to follow
Niggas say it's real rough today and I say what you say
They promised me 40 acres and a mule and all I got was a project and a
Subway
I stay positive, niggas mistake that for not hard
Nigga I'm GOD, walk thru North America like Master Farrad
Me and my squad, separating the peas from the pod
No bodyguard, fuck around and roll a tank thru your yard
Chorus
Verse Two: Sadat X
Yeah
Man, these dick-in-the-butt rappers could get shot in the face
Dragged thru the streets and probably left some place
I seem shootouts in the park
Ball games turned tragic, bitch niggas gettin smacked and smacked again
In front of they girl, and she's throwing away that ass
And I ain't really asked for it cos a lot of niggas tore it
And yes, my man Hav had bought me something from VA
I was gonna hit him with doe but he ain't reall want no shorts
Cos we had worked together and he knew I was true blue
Man, I swore I would never go to VA again
Until I found out who killed my best friend
I can tell by the wind somebody's gettin ready to bend
They lifestyle's bout to end
I'm in these African cabs on stores run by the Arabs
With pictures of yen, seem like they schemin
Herculoid cats get flattened and reduced to pitchin
That girl gave you crabs but I can't explain those scabs
 Ha ha, where we at? Flash one-time
Chorus 
Ha, '98, too soon
Brand Nubian, what?Il est temps que les grands crèvent l'écran
Si t'as du cran sers les dents, pas de guerre sans verser l'sang
Attaque en règle, les seuils battent en retraite
Nubi Sale fait mal comme une batte en fer qui te frappe en pleine tête... brulée
Faites fumer pour me calmer,
je viens tuer pour mieux palper
J'suis à cran, décidé à prendre ce qu'y a à prendre
Comme ceux qui n'ont rien, résignés à vendre ce qu'y a à vendre
J'suis à deux doigts d'craquer, à deux doigts d'te claquer parce que d'une : j'peux pas t'saquer
Et de deux : tu mens mais tu peux pas m'blaguer
Et de trois : de toi à moi je crois qu'tu veux racailler mais tu n'es pas de taille
Et tu n'es pas taillé dans le bois de ceux qui bataillent pour pouvoir grailler
J'ai de l'expérience petit, et une longue espérance de vie dans ce biz
Crois-moi quand j'te dis que...
Ma zic t'emmène où ça pue la pisse
, t'as vu l'affiche
On part en virée nocturne dans les cités obscures
(Ça c'est seulement pour les
sy, sy, sy, sy, sy
)
C'est pour les belles gosses tréssées aux fesses compressées
C'est pour les scarlas, pour les scarlettes, pour les cailleras, pour les starlettes
Pas de strass et pas de paillettes, rien ne m'arrête
N'essaie pas d'me test, moi j'te baise
J'peux te tuer en une ligne comme un rail de cess
Les bails de tess et la chiennance, j'connais sur le bout des doigts
Ce qui fait une sacré différence entre vous et moi
J'mange du béton depuis ma naissance, vends du bédo dès l'adolescence sur les bancs du Péron
Accompagné de mes comparses et associés
Y'a d'la fraîche à faire et ce serai con d'passer à côté
Maintenant j'rappe,
bouge plus de niacs
Reste cool pour mes youths
, pète et bouge sur le track
Mise tout sur le bail, même si j'suis sur pas du tout de graille
, shoote sur le mic
Kicke pour les gars d'en bas
C'est l'Essone en plein essor, attends-toi aux genres de trucs auxquels on s'attend pas
Lis ma vie de page en page, des histoires qui transpercent le cœur de part en part
Vaut mieux pas qu'j'en parle
Ma zic t'emmène où ça pue la pisse
, t'as vu l'affiche
On part en virée nocturne dans les cités obscures
C'est pour les belles gosses tréssées aux fesses compressées
C'est pour les scarlas, pour les scarlettes, pour les cailleras, pour les starlettes
Pas de strass et pas de paillettes, rien ne m'arrête
On reconnaît ma force de frappe, mes sortes de sapes
Les gars m'détestent, les belles gosses me palpent
Les cops me traquent, crois-pas qu'ça m'donne le trac
Nubi Sale te bloque, te choque, provoque le crash
Donne le cash même si j'kicke pour l'amour
Et j'kiffe quand ça goome, quand ça "click" quand ça "boom"
Ma tique dans ma bouche, des balles dans ma tête
Alors cale quand ça pète car ça kill quand ça touche
J'assassine au mic, spliff de cannabis au bec
Non c'est pas facile de test une carabine au mic
J'suis un gun vivant, un jeune dit-ban
J'aligne à la file indienne, au suivant !
Un par un, j'suis comme un parrain du rap
J'suis un fléau dans ta stéréo, un mal incurable
Et si t'es malin tu traces, sans jamais te retourner
C'est Nubi du 9.1 si jamais tu veux m'trouver
Dans un stand où y'a du shit et des armes avec...
Tu sais déjà j'vais pas t'citer des blazes
Mais mes frelots savent qui ils sont, tous des hommes par définition
Coupé sport, toute nouvelle acquisition
C'est l'argent de la drogue
,
on a pas tous la chance d'avoir les avances de la prod'
Alors les frelots crament des caisses, braquent des caisses dans les singam
Sèchent les cours, fuck les exams et poussent la djeze, grave
Ma zic t'emmène où ça pue la pisse
, t'as vu l'affiche
On part en virée nocturne dans les cités obscures
C'est pour les belles gosses tréssées aux fesses compressées
C'est pour les scarlas, pour les scarlettes, pour les cailleras, pour les starlettes
Pas de strass et pas de paillettes, rien ne m'arrêteIntro/Chorus: Shelene
Too late, too late baby, bye-bye
I'll be there tonight
You'll get left behind
Now's my time to shine
Verse One: Grand Puba
Now I got the best birthday present when my ass born
It was my mama, old dad plant the seed like a farmer
Life was kind of hard livin in hell's backyard
Didin't have a job, honey fronted on the GOD
Shorty racing, only hollering at cats who be lacin
She had some shit with her, she was caught up in the glitter
"Brother come see me when you get five digits bigger"
Oh that's the way you tryin to doo-doo on a nigga
She likes the lavish, no time for a brother livin average
Play the knees for the cheese like a savage
Now she lost and turned out, rotten teeth in her mouth
Cos she ran the wrong route
Shorty 'member me, now I'm seven digits bigger
Platinum artist status, mad cheese from Hilfiger
Now ya feelin me because you're smoked out and high
But too late baby, bye-bye
Chorus
Verse Two: Lord Jamar
I wish you could have been there when I had my first fight
The other kid said he was gonna get his father
I didn't bother to respond cos I knew that you was gone
Forced to carry on and teach myself right from wrong
As far back as I can remember you was never around
In September it was back to school
The eldest member of my family so I packed the tool
It made a nigga feel manly when I smacked a fool
With it, could've schooled me on pussy before I hit it
Or took me to a park with a ball and said "Hit it"
But we was all left in the dark, accepting the parts
Of you we was able to get, affectin my heart
Nowadays you expecting to start, anew
When I lived my whole life apart from you
Too late you better check the due date
See there's no explanation for the expiration
Chorus
Bridge: Sherene
It's too late, bye-bye
Oh bye-bye-bye-bye-bye-byeeee, yeah
It's too late, bye-bye, oh babe
Bye-bye-bye-bye-byeeee-bye-bye
Bye-bye-bye-bye-byeeeee
Verse Three: Sadat X
Niggas disrespect my crib droppin ashes on the floor
Another half of beer I'm findin behind the chair
Let you meal like you wish but you can't even wash a dish
But you love to eat and rest them stink ass feet
And blow up my telephone line like you was home
Seen a nigga make five quick calls to the dome
Ride around all day, 'Dro-ed or hash
I ain't never heard once "Can I help you with gas?"
I ain't never heard "X, can I buy you a meal?"
But if we going downtown niggas is ready to wheel
Now if you broke you broke, you got five dollars, give me one
Cos most likely I'll give it back before the day is done
If I'm spendin and bending, you should do it pendin
That day when you break out and finally get your cake
But I don't let that stress me cos life is but a test, B
And every waken day, I'ma stay okay
Chorus to fadeYeah, yeah, fo' your mind
Hmmmright, let's see what we can come up with
Record after record, yeaaah, rhyme after rhyme check it
In the studio, on the first try
On the verse high only birds fly
You get out the pack like that y'all
Straight off da head , let niggas know I use to wear the pro
Get three strikes yo, I used to have to court awarder
But now I got a daughter and she gotta grow
And I let her know that that ain't the way to go
My name is X, yo I'm like a puzzle when I get released
Just like I had my muzzle off, check it out yo
I can never be sold
You don't stop  and you don't stop
 Ya don't stop
Comin straight off da head one time it's the dread Lord J
Come around the way, would you say?
One time with my crew, manifessin
Just like that, now who you think you tessin? Uhh
Brand Nubian, my crew be in effect, uhh
Get erect with the blunts and ya check
Right in, one time, goin to the bank, I'm
Cashin, and you know I be stashin
In the mattress, one time with the phatness
Beats, I be blowin up, showin up
At shows, checkin all the hoes
Just like that and defeatin all my foes
Go for jack
Yo my name is X, yo my name is X and I was born in
The BX, I went to New Rochelle
Know my man Mark the Spark who live in the Vernon
And my man be they rhythm, dwell in Bronxdale, in the home of the
Boss, goin down the block or go to forest
Keep on goin past Morris High School
Then I go down the street to Courtland Ave
Vietnam, the male goes in Jackson
Over the bridge, on 45th to 8th Ave
Go to 7th Ave., go to Polo Grounds
Go to Drewham, 1-0-6 all the way to 1-10
Black Puerto Rican and Dominican, check it out
Uhh, we're gonna show you how we live, take you straight across the bridge
To Medina where the GODs is meaner, wisdom is cleaner
Straight down on Flatbush Ave
Some of the streets in Brooklyn'll make you laugh
Names like Myrtle and Willoughby
Things like Scurmerhorn and Classun
And funny names like that but still they got the gats rollin
Just like that that's how we be strollin
Maestro Manny and my man Big Ill, we fill blunts
Just like that we kill stunts
Guts, and what'cha want like that, we got nuts
Just like that cos it's phat, uhhh
Check it out, yeah 
And I keep on goin, I keep on goin 
My head keep goin on
Rob deep from mackadocious, your cut be close
With the one blade, ever since the first grade
I been a fan of the rap and I can do this
I use to watch and listen, and watch the ol' time greats
And watch em how they did things and I learned it well
I rip in New Rochelle, that's where I dwell 
Check it out, my name is X, yo my man Mark the Spark's with me
My man Serge got the urge to splurge, he came from Cleveland
All the way from Ohio, he's gonna letcha know
Can you deal with his flow, yo yo?
Aiyo, peace to the GODs, peace to the Earth
Peace to the birth of me and my seed Khari
It's like that in effect one time, and I'm
The black man, intelligent with the plan
Islam be the bomb, droppin on the devils
Goin to a higher level
Peace to Farrakhan and the Nation like that
Creation is black, one time, that's a fact
Original solar, I'm Lord Jamar, yes I be the
Intelligent one, I be the sun shinin
Like the light in the night, but still I be bright
One time, now I recite the lessons for ya
One time, messin for ya or
Check it out, without a doubt
Peace to the GODs, sincere, makin it clear
Peace to Tamiq, yeah that's the language we speak
Peace to Knowledge, he didn't go to college
But still he got the supreme mind"You'll be always mine... all through your life
Think you'll find, you'll be always mine...
All through your life, think you'll find
You'll be always mine"
You gon' always be mine, no matter who else in line
And deep down, you know that in your heart
We occasionally live life dreams
Time stood still, and split up the seams
Years can be brutal but it served you well
You mighta gained a pound but I can't tell
Who me?  I'm in the same vein, healthy
Not as wealthy as I wanna be, but I'm aight
But to you that never mattered anyway
I couldn't stand in yo' way when you choose to grow
Said you had to follow yo' lifelong dreams
To the lands of the stars, cameras, lights
Bright sunny days and we parted our ways
Then the hourglass with the sand slipped fast
Now we are where we are today, in oh-four
And maybe it'll happen once more
But if don't, know our time together was golden
Memories I'ma keep holdin, and know I'm here
And one more thing my dear 
("You'll be always mine... all through your life
Think you'll find, you'll be always mine...")
Yo, we first met in junior high
I was so shy, you was so fly
At first I done knew you would be mine
Clocked in, started doin my time
Walkin you home, hours, we talked on the phone
Eventually, we started to bone
In a whirlwind, you became my girlfriend
We used to both rock the matchin Sherlings
With the sweatshirts, with our names on it
On the back it had our love proclaimed on it
Then we broke up, and got back together
Then we broke up, and got back together
It was like that, for what seemed forever
Then it got to the point that we had to sever
The years had passed
And wouldn't you know it, met and her yo we crossed paths
And I have to laugh
Cause it didn't take nuttin for a nigga to smash, cause
("You'll be always mine... all through your life
Think you'll find, you'll be always mine...")
I couldn't wait to walk to school each day
And wait for you to pass my way 
I never really had nuttin to say, but
How ya doin, and have a nice day
Until one day, one Monday
I put the mack down, recess playground
Ever since then homegirl been down
Feelin my style cause I wasn't no clown
From, element through the college days
Did shows after school, used to bring you backstage
We reminisce on how we used to play
When I got sick, you got sick the same days
Okay?  you know how that go 
Mom at work, so we got the fo'
Half hour for the cleanup then you out the do'
Walked down one flight to be safe fo' sho'
After, all that shorty love still with it
How I put my thang down and the way I hit it, so
("You'll be always mine... all through your life
Think you'll find, you'll be always mine...")Intro/Chorus:
Sweatin bullets, watch me pull it on a motherfucker 
Sweatin bullets, wet a whole clip for the suckers 
Sweatin bullets, watch me pull it on a motherfucker 
Sweatin bullets, if I flip then I'm gonna fuck it 
*repeat*
Verse One: Sadat X
For the next couple of seconds or however long it takes
I'mma hit y'all with somethin far below Christ or nothin
Couldn't get a better deal if this was Vegas
Ain't no cards on the table, just a bottle of Black Label
And a picture of your girl who I said was sweatin bullets
Reach for it, pull it, or we'll always have beef
You'll be scared to walk the streets, sweatin up your sheets
You bought a ticket to Jamaica, I caught you at the airport
Blood spilled on your dome, which funeral dome is da
One preferred, all expenses occurred
To the one who sweats the bullet, slugs, thugs and drugs
Or whoever bring it better be able to sing it
Cos the song of a dead man's a sad one
And a family without a son is a mad one
Sweatin bullets and I know you love your family
But Money you can't scare me or when I'm feelin *?melly?*
You could get over but I'mma bring ya back down
Play ya like a clown, from the brother's ringling
Your spine is tinglin, you can't feel your legs
"Will I ever walk to the doctor?" you begs
The hot one shattered your spinal vertebrae
Remember that shit that you said the other day
They gotcha style with the dead arm
Take the dead aim and flash your name
Chorus
Verse Two: Lord Jamar
I'm sweatin motherfuckers like Jack LeLaine, I packs the pain
I'll rack your brain, leave you in a sack wit your name
Hangin from your toe as I'm bangin your ho
She'll be slangin pussy down in Magic City, bringin me doe
If you don't know it's Lord Jamar from the Nubian set
No matter who the fuck you are we're puttin down the sweat
Servin heat on a motherfucker's street
Bullets be dripped whiles a motherfucker trippin
You'll never catch me slippin cos I got my rubber soles
The devils make me sick, I'd love to fill em full of holes
Kill em all in the daytime, broad motherfuckin daylight
12 o'clock, grab the Glock while waitin for the night
We sweatin motherfuckin bullets, and if we break a sweat
That means we'll make ya wet
I'll take your life and
jet back to some place cooler
Now Ruler is where my burner gets the fueler
If niggas wanna do I got the
hollow point teflon
The kind niggas will vest then get laid to rest on
So niggas bring your best on but I suggest you invest on
A burial plot cos shit is gettin hot, we're sweatin bullets
ChorusYoung young son, yea, dont let me down young son, uh huh, am trusting you
Young son, uh, dont let me down young son, uh huh, am trusting you young
Son, young son, dont let be down young son, uh huh, am truting you young
Son, uh, dont let me down young son am trusting you young son
Now don't get caught up by the corner
You know these blocks be hotter than a sauna 
Don't let them peers put the pressure on ya
And when you make moves, make moves cause you wanna 
Don't get caught up on some monkey-see, monkey-do
Stay focused, and understand the thug in you 
And just handle your business
And always be persistent, like Jehovah's Witness 
And never take no for a answer
Unless it be a chick cause you could end up in some shit 
Like some bull shit they hit Kobe with
You dont want to be a baby daddy better rubber it 
See am just telling you what I know
Dont let haters mess with your flow
Dont be stupid and trick your dough
And always be careful of them shiesty hoes 
Yea
Young son don't let me down young son am trusting you
Young son
I need you to hold the fort down
I ain't liking how this judge in court sound
I might have to spend time away from the fam
And if I do then I'm a need you to act like a man 
This is no time for tears
It's time for you to man up, time to face your fears
Looks like your old dad might face some years
Don't allow the family name to be disgraced and smeared 
Protect your mother and little sister
If anybody diss them become the pain inflictor
So much responsibility I hope you can handle it
Here take this 9 mill son I hope you can handle it 
You're my only hope for the future
And knowing you can do it gives me hope for the future
Son I trust you this is something that you must do
Till they release me from these walls or I bust through 
Young son dont let me down young son am trusting you
Young son
One young son, he want to get a scholarship
The other want to get a whip from the car dealership
Chips off the old' block is what pop will say
One's on the court, one's in court all day
A mother's heart smiles and it grieves at once
She cries at home, but in the public she fronts
'Where did we fail? How did we prevail?
From the diploma ceremony to the jail it's a journey
One wants to beef one one needs a attorney
Two separate from life there heart beats as one
They came in to this world together as twins
And as long as the world spins they'll be joining
You could say one was annoying the other disappointed
But they still love each other they should there brothers
Son get your brother out of jail
Because with a little bit of love he can heel 
Young son dont let me down young son am trusting you
Young son Explain the women that I keep
Goin through my house and shit when I'm asleep
We bang heads a lot, we bang beds a lot
You ask questions a lot, and try to trip me up
But I ain't never been the one that's tryin to bend
And no it wasn't me that was seen by your friends
She thinks she saw me, makin shit stormy
Most in my path'll probably say they love me
Say they thinkin of me but they can't be with me
It's no hate, one was even tryin to wait
So for her I tried to run my shit straight
Did I want to set the date, I said let's leave it by fate, and then she skate
The world ain't shit and everything ain't great
Whoever in this trade done swayed into the cons
Of they sexual liasons and past dealings
Smashed the four wheel and stay forever concealed
Where are you now, that, I need you, with me
Where are you now, that, the chips, are down
Where are you now, I'm, sad, and, lonely
Now that I need you girl, you're, not around
It seem like 85% of most bitches more concerned about
Niggas with riches but uncapable of washin the dishes
Attitude always suspicious, she fulfill your every wishes
And she dig the way you got up in them britches
Always expressin her undyin love for a thug
Now who said you can't find romance in a nightclub
Now you bugged, backrubs in the hot tub
Got you believin that this pigeon ain't thinkin dubs
Damn, she like game airtight, but you know the rule
When you bag a joint and twist it on the first night 
That shit's a might if the ass is alright
If that shit ain't really tight, she probably did the same thing last night
'Long as the paper pilin, then she smilin
Ain't thinkin 'bout whylin, you takin her to different islands
But let your paper fall short, Cristal turn to cork
Then you turn around and ask that bitch for support
Uh, uh, yo
When a nigga had money you was there; funny how
Everytime I turned around, you was there
When it was time for you to get your hair  your nails and your gear
But at my court date, you failed to appear
Fought my case on appeals, it took over a year
And in that time, a nigga didn't see nor hear
Got to the point there was no respect at all
I was shocked when you did not collect my call
Spent nights in my cell just beatin my dick
Thinkin 'bout, how we used to fuck and shit
I took you out, bought your ass a bunch of shit
When I get out, I'm gonna fuckin punch this bitch
Right then I'm out, cause she don't understand the rules
You don't bite the man that dipped your hand in jewels
You were there when I bought the rock to blind you
Now a nigga locked and I can't find you
 - 2X
Where are you now [
1er couplet :
Nubi]
(
Ok
) Les caisses brûlent, la tess hurle et la bataille fait rage
Je n'vers'rais pas de larmes pour des tas d'ferrailles (
jamais
)
Mes soldats dans la rue portent pas d'médailles
Mais ils portent leur couilles et portent les coups quand ils frappent l'État
Alors reste en retrait, c'est la tess qu'on représente
Victimes au passé blessent dans le présent
Pour l'instant je pressens l'intense pression
Constante oppression le stress m'a rendu méchant
Tu veux canaliser mon animosité (
aaah
) mais as-tu vraiment analysé la vie dans nos cités ?
Sais-tu ce que c'est de vivre sans thunes ?
Tout l'temps ivre et sans but, ta raison fout l'camp
Marianne t'es qu'une Jézabelle, fais la belle
J'te bais'rais jusqu'à c'qu'tu m'aimes pour soigner ma peine
Je te souhaite tout le mal que tu m'as fait
Alors maintenant tu m'écoutes quand j'te parle et tu la fermes (
Ok
)

Refrain x2 :
Nubi]
C'est pour les frérots qu'on assassine

La voix des déshérités, je rôde et je gronde
J'suis la cité, j'ai choqué la France, choqué le monde

2ème couplet :
Nubi]
Nos positions sont fermes, nos convictions sont vraies
Tu craques quand un flic braque un brolic sur ton frère
C'est pas nous les criminels, on est juste affamés, pour manger on est plus qu'acharner alors
Si jamais ça explose  et que rien n'change (
rien n'change
)
Y aura plein d'gens qui s'battront pour la même cause (
pour la même cause
)
Alors capitule, qui tu crois qu'tu manipules
En plein hiver on t'a fait voir la canicule (
ahah
)
On en a rien à cirer, trop d'nos potes ont des peine à tirer
Trop d'Robocop non pas d'peine à tirer
Deux de nos p'tits frères ne verront pas le mois d'Décembre
Alors le ghetto pleure des larmes d'essence
Elles coulent sur l'asphalte qui s'embrase
On freine pas un lascar qui s'sent mal parce qu'il vit en marge
Et maintenant que l'armée s'est mise en marche
Ça va barder, regardez les dégâts, c'est juste une mise en garde

Refrain x4

C'est pour les frérots qu'on assassine

J'suis la cité, j'ai choqué la France, choqué le mondeLES PORTES DU SOUVENIR
Elle se donne un instant pour réfléchir
Pour laisser aller ses sentiments
Son prince doit venir
Ses songes l'emportent
Enfin, elle croit voir l'avenir
Ses amants passés se pressent sur son corps alangui
Elle a ouvert les portes du souvenir
Son passé ressurgit sans mentir
Elle a ouvert les portes du souvenir
Elle qui attend et qui poursuit l'avenir
Elle rêve et se rappelle tous ses chagrins d'amour
Ses amours éphémères qu'elle voit d'un nouveau jour
Ceux qui ont su le rendre heureuse
Et qui n'etaient plus rien
Dès l'aube enjôleuse
Elle a ouvert les portes du souvenir
Son passé ressurgit sans mentir
Elle a ouvert les portes du souvenir
Elle qui attend et qui poursuit l'avenir
Elle a ouvert les portes du souvenir
Son passé ressurgit sans mentir
Elle a ouvert les portes du souvenir
Elle qui attend celui qui est son avenirWe dealin with death, in abundance
Dirty guns and, the pungent smell, of those who fell
Bodies, like commodoties, ready to sell
Take you around the world for a hundred dollars
Meanwhile, a little baby hollers
Hopin that she doesn't follow in her mother's footsteps
Of drugs and sex, every day, more thugs to arrest
And today could be the day you catch a slug in your chest
Funny thing about life - nobody, gets out alive
The trick is to see, how long, you can survive
We deprived of our basic needs
Sufferin at the hands of a racist greed
In the black wo-man's where I place my seed
When they grow, will they know, that I tried to make it better for them?
Will I be dead or inside of a federal pen?
Niggas just don't learn, niggas just won't learn
As we walk through the valley of dry bones
Death from, New York to Cali, the shit hits homes
Niggas with 40 calibers, that'll split ya bone
Other niggas with silencers, with gats that's chrome
It seems the violence only escalates, I'm concerned
When the slug penetrate your flesh, see it burn
Livin with the constant threat, that it could be yo' turn
Niggas just don't learn, niggas just won't learn
On 8th Ave, keep bouncin in the Mave'
He don't even know the type of problems he gon' have
He facin obstacles, greed, it's the large city need
Remember when he ain't smoke weed
Jail hold's raw, spittin seed
In the Polo Grounds, in 89 we dodged steed
All the slaves ain't freed
Make him the captain, muh'fucker we'll lead
Shoot him in the chest muh'fucker will bleed
Cause way he's goin he's gon' need God-speed
I seen a man die, gettin shot in the eye
And then leave this earth with a sigh
I wish I had a dollar for every funeral parlor
That I been to, and I ain't tryin to end to
I've been a friend to a lot of dead niggas
With multiple gunshots, niggas used to run spots
Now little shorties don't have a chance
Cause hard times be comin down like a avalanche
We play the streets until we carried on a ambulance
Day by day we be the victims of the circumstance
See the poison has us movin at a steady flow
It filters through your radio and your video
You ever once stop to think and wonder why it's so?
We don't know cause we blinded by the fog of 'dro, so we let it go
We dedicate our whole careers to save our dyin nation
Cause what we facin is the process of elimination
So busy chasin that our history begins erasin
A savage nation that is headin for anihilation
Time out - put the killin to a drought
And shorty stop runnin around puttin all them dicks in yo' mouth
I be concerned cause we burn baby burn
And we just don't, learn
 - 2X"It's the return of the motherfuckin dreadlock" 
"Anyway you come I'm in your motherfuckin shit, man"
"Lord Jamar will live long
Cause I give strong blows to the heads of my foes" 
Well it's the Lord J lightin up more shit than Broadway
And Times Square wit nuff rhymes for your air
Crimes appear to have no motive, I wrote a
Shit I seen on the street now y'all fiend for the beat
Like a crackhead but this black dread don't sell drugs
Although I dwell with the, thugs
New Rochelle bust slugs from the tool in the Rule
Leavin devils mugs in a blood pool
Just like mud makes fossil fuels, colossal be the jewels I drop
The way I schools this thru hip-hop
I rip shop like shit was made of paper mache
My shape was tip-top and it can be no greater display
I pray today and see the devil takin off the Earth
But I'm lay it, keep on makin shit for what it's worth
A butter verse over a beat that's pancake fat
Niggas know it's like that and it's like that
"Lord Jamar will live long
Cos I give strong blows to the hoes and my foes"
"Lord Jamar will live long
Cos I give strong blows to the hoes and my foes"
"It's the return of the motherfuckin dreadlock"
"Lord Jamar will live long
Cos I give strong blows to the hoes and my foes"
"Lord Jamar will live long
Cos I give strong blows to the hoes and my foes"
"Anyway you come I'm in your motherfuckin shit, mate"
Now this is for my niggas who ain't fuckin with the system
Tired of arrest, doin the best to try to dick em up the ass
With no grease, the fuckin police gots ta go
Niggas feel the same from Maine to Chicago
California to New York, gotta warn ya bout the pork
Baby, on a fuckin hawk
Lookin for a nigga so they can dig another grave
My big brother was a slave but I'm like Nat Turner with two burners
Bustin back cos I'm black
Now you learn a lesson on how to act
Messin with original seed'll cause you to bleed
Broke the universal laws now we're smokin yours
Provoke cause the effect, and effective immediately
We're gonna wreck shit repeatedly
I ain't goin out wit out retaliatin, I got my niggas in the alley waitin
Ready to bring the heat to Satan
Where he lives, there he is, handle your biz
His mantle is wigged, you watch the pig squeel
Ain't no big deal, far better worse was done to us
It's time he run from us, nigga grab your gun and bust
"Lord Jamar will live long
Cos I give strong blows to the heads of my foes"
"Lord Jamar will live long
Cos I give strong blows to the heads my foes"
"It's the return of the motherfuckin dreadlock" 
Hypnotic, psychotic, women have erotic thoughts of me
Devils wanna torture me
They'd like to string me up round my neck from a tree
Simply for the fact I'm a real motherfuckin G-O-to the D
Niggas know me for speakin on the reals
Freakin in my wheels with the cops on my heels
He drops when I peels his cap with the real rap
Thinkin bout takin me out, I can't feel that
"Lord Jamar will live long
Cos I give strong blows to the heads of my foes"
"Lord Jamar will live long
Cos I give strong blows to the heads of my foes"
"It's the return of the motherfuckin dreadlock" 
Outro: 
"It's the return of the motherfuckin dreadlock"Yeah.. put 'em up, put 'em up, put 'em up
 uhh, got a knot
 yeah
 uhh
Y'all know what time it is, let's get it crackin
Push up on a shorty, no slackin, just start mackin
Lay yo' shit down, baby ain't no time to clown
Takin Southbound but I turn around where it start gettin brown
I ain't no dooty hound, shit I lay my duty down
Pound for pound, Brand Nu one of the best around
I put like 20 some odd years up in the projects
Gourmet chef with welfare cheese before these record checks
I used to steal my mom's whip, sneak up in the club
Get back to the parkin lot, the next door neighbor jacked my spot
Ahhhhhhh... shhhhit...
... excuse me miss you got to move your car
And I took a dub before I stole {?} shit
That's all I need now for her ass to really flip
I'm 2 strikes and 3 quarters from a pink slip
I'm glad I'm makin hits, y'all know the chorus, sing this shit
 yeah
 uhh
Morph into somethin terrible, my presence unbearable, parable
A spittin Bronx legend like Larry Davis
Make police think about it on they routine tours
Through the war's lifestyle, hell scene, shells and void sales
Avoid bails, avoid jails, I'm four-eyed
Who's ridin who inside?  Who say they know me
I give great, atmosphere, like a open bar
You got to scratch and claw, you tryin to match the star
Hit me on my cellular, six for my dick
My man is on the phone cryin over some chick, yo call me back
My exact measure make the world my treasure
And since we only live once the world's my pleasure, who want booze?
Broads, dice game and cards
Houses with yards, feel the blast from the glass shards
Who got colored bags, who got colored rags, straight brims for ya block
Be from {?} in pairs
I move these crabs out my life like they musical chairs
 yeah
 raise ya hands
 if ya gotta knot
 if you want a knot
Now I don't lust over money
But if I had to do it, I would bust over money
Let's not have a dispute and cause disgust over money
Cause we can cut and shoot and shed the blood over money
But that wouldn't be right, yo
Gotta have some, money in yo' pocket
How the fuck you 'sposed to hit the supermarket?
You can't even get the stain out your carpet
Without havin little money in your pocket
I know you wanna get the chain with the locket
Buy a plane so you can sit up in the cockpit
All day gettin brains from a hot bitch
Layin back, spendin change on a ostrich
Or would you settle for just gettin out the projects
Pay off your debts, make a little progress
Either way the only thing that could stop it
Is not havin no, money in your pocket
 got a knot
 want a knot
 need a knot
 uh-huh
 got a knot
 want a knot
 need a knot
 yeahWho wanna be a star?  Be out late night under the moon
Got a plan to get dough and be rich by June
And all the broads, sexual, yeah ultimate head
But, over one chick I seen two niggas dead
Who's God?  Know theyself and still know math
And be that same bad nigga that's hawkin on the ave
It's Brand Nu baby, it's Brand Nu
It's Brand Nu baby, it's Brand Nu
Uhhh, Lord Jamar, rap caviar
Guitar loop in a Jaguar Coupe
Combat boots, fatigue suit, niggas that's ready to shoot
And "Ready to Die" like Biggie Smalls
We can drop our drawers, see who got the bigger balls
The way I act'll be forever called a nigga y'all
Tattoos on my arms and neck, bomb the set
If you havin trouble payin me, pawn the baguettes
Cause I be comin armed with, more than a threat
All my LG niggas, why don't y'all tell these niggas
Treat 'em like paper trees and fell these niggas
Now it's all I can do not to smell these niggas
These Brooklyn blocks is lookin hot
These motherfuckin cops, is tryin to put me in they cookin pot
But the shit it ain't gon' never stop
Forever playin the block, if you like it or not
At the bassline I blow your mind at the top
When the melody drop - I'm still here
It's psycho Western what happened on Creston A-V-E
Bronx community, one-eight-three
Who is the summer heat for winter leather
Rims, rings, neck look gleamy bitch eyes look steamy
She said she been smokin outdoor all day
Let my find out my Bronx niggas hit you I'll be up when it's {?}
When the sun go down, I lose round on the ground
One stuck in your crown, whoever zoos rendezvous
With they crews, these drawers rip for free
And if I can't touch, then I got to pop the clutch
Non-touchin broad is a fraud
She prayed to the Lord and get fucked in a Ford
And she a bad bitch, daddy rich, cousin used to pitch
Faggot-ass brother gotta switch
Uhh, now from way back when, when you gettin up goin to work
I'm just gettin in, smellin like a pint of gin
Up in the rathole, where ghetto bitches sellin they souls
Cause it's after 4 and all the discoes is closed
Nigga I'm up when you up, and I'm up when you sleep
Bouncin around in the black dirty offroad Jeep
Wakin people up tryin to sleep
Cause like the first time, this time, we makin the beats
The undeniable, satisfiable, reliable, Brand Nubian
Now you know we come with the bomb
So hi-tech, see us on your DVD-ROM
Get love from little kids like a Pokemon
Everytime we spit that shit it be our word is bond
See I been down in the trenches where projects hazard
Where them visions of wire fences and dopefiends ran the yard
I ain't the sixth sense, I'm the 7th sense
 - 2XJ'ai vu, de mes yeux vu
Des voies perte de vue
Tu m'a servi de guide
Sur cette terre inconnue
Oh, Femme d'Afrique
Oh Princesse Nubienne
Aujourd'hui ton sang irrigue mes veines
J'ai pris la parole au milieu du silence
Pour chanter tes louanges
Oh, Femme d'Afrique
C'est au nom d'un peuple toujours en effervescence
Que ma voix s'ÈlËve
Que mon ‚me se rÈveille
Dans la peau d'une princesse nubienne
Dans la peau d'une de celles
Qui m'Èpaule comme une mËre
Quand je suis seule face au blues
Les nuits de veillÈe je me retrouve
Donne-moi une bonne raison
De me glacer la mÈmoire
De ne plus m'abreuver dans les puits de l'histoire
L'heure o les mensonges se transforment en songes
J'ai trouvÈ un remËde ce mal qui me ronge
J'ai pris la parole au milieu du silence
Pour chanter tes louanges
Oh, Femme d'Afrique
C'est au nom d'un peuple
Toujours en effervescence
Que ma voix s'ÈlËve
Que mon ‚me se rÈveille
Dans la peau d'une princesse nubienne
Dans la peau d'une de celles
Qui m'Èpaule comme une mËre
Quand je suis seule face au blues
Les nuits de veillÈe je me retrouveAiyyo we came up together, flamed up weed together
Changed our names together, even had seeds together
Everyday we used to be together, got tattoos together
Drank brews together
Fucked hoes together, did shows together
Bought jewels, bought clothes together, we was close together
Bust guns together, we would run together
Said we would be, Dunns forever
And shine like the sun together, and never sever
And down for whatever's clever
They say two heads is better so let's put it together
We can get the cheddar comin back to back like a doubleheader
I can't believe we not still together
'Member back in the days, when we used to get ill together
We was ready to kill together, make blood spill together
Now we hardly even chill together
Whatever happened to you? - We were true blue
No limitations on the things that we used to do
Whatever happened to him? - My man got bagged
He in the pen and he might not see daylight again
Whatever happened to her? - She had two seeds
Now she's smokin and she just ain't the way she was
Whatever happened to them? - Now they started as friends
But it seem like they blowin in the wind
Heads are laid out in the dojo
Threw you a lifeline from K-Ci and JoJo
We crossed the earth on airplanes
Don't worry about a thing, lay back and get {?}
Damn silky slim was the bad thing
Used to spread her out her man was down in the bing
Knew it couldn't last like that
For the niggas that I knew that got blast like that
She got this nigga's pictures on the wall
Out with the baby eatin dinner at the mall
Told me she was from Madison
But A.G. and them told me she was really from Patterson
Thought she was 18 then
But she was 16 and had been fuckin grown men
Wild, that was way back when
I still think of shorty and want to smash her again
For the third time my man got knocked
'Cept he was gettin tired of 3 hots and a cot
Now his short stay is a very long stay
From all them yak sales in the project hallways
Now a nigga blew trial and started coppin
But ain't nuttin poppin 'less you messin with a nigga like Johnny Cochran
Up North, Comstock; caught a flashback
Cause that's the same place I used to go check my pops
Damn, here we go again
My man John {?} won't see New York 'til about 2010
It be the same ol' ghetto shit; send me some flicks
Some chips, some commisary, some groceries and some kicks
It be a plot while we in the trenches
Playin the project benches, thinkin {?}
For those who know the woes, the highs and the lows
The wind blows and the grass grows soUhh, one time for my peoples that be lovin the rhyme 
We keep it bubblin, even in these troublin times
And two times for my people who be givin support 
Showin us love in this rap sport 
One time for my peoples that be lovin the rhyme
We keep it bubblin, even in these troublin times
And two times for my people who be givin support 
Showin us love in this rap sport
I'm enhancin, with the ? slams of hash
If the hellion pick on the black skelly
You ridin in cabs, from the Harlem and the ? van
With two hundred fan, to the telly wop and you don't stop
Uhh, you go for this like a gofer but my shit be protected
Like the plastic on your grandmother's sofa
See more pennies than a loafer, whip the SP-500
No chauffeur, if I slide to the ?, make sure I keep a prophy-
-lactic, mathematical tactics
We never movin backwards, attractive
To the active, mental state, and these black kids
Can relate, to the shit we spit on the wax plate
The have-nots in this world is the type that lose they girl
? got stacked, but you ain't matched your mack
Them folks'll make it happen, somedays I say fuck rappin
In the Jimmy's Cafe suaree, I will play 
Uhh, one time for my peoples that be lovin the rhyme 
 We keep it bubblin, even in these troublin times
And two times for my people who be givin support
Showin us love in this rap sport  
One time for my peoples that be lovin the rhyme
We keep it bubblin, even in these troublin times 
And two times for my people who be givin support
Showin us love in this rap sport
Now I be the minnnnd bogglin, iced tea gogglin
Rhyme style thorough, collect paper like the Tri-Boro
My flows release from New York to the Middle East
Go and ask your niece, want a piece?  Hot like fish grease
This release we bout to let go'z'about to set mo'
Niggas on they ass, figurin we pass
You fuckin with an all-star cast, Lord Jamar, Grand Puba
And Sadat make it hot for your ras claat
I'm stompin all these prices, known to blow out sales
Fly enough to be whale, with my eyes open keep the clutch
Tone, everything, that I touch, I own
And I'll be here doin my thing, til my daughter is grown
Now it's from New York to Tokyo, Guanamana Me-xi-co
Point me out at Tex-a-co, and watch the Range Rover flow
Play it in your hood cause I be that damn good
Slam my balls, up in more holes, than Tiger Woods
Uhh, one time for my peoples that be lovin the rhyme 
 We keep it bubblin, even in these troublin times
And two times for my people who be givin support
Showin us love in this rap sport  
One time for my peoples that be lovin the rhyme 
 We keep it bubblin, even in these troublin times 
And two times for my people who be givin support
Showin us love in this rap sport 
It be the rich and the prominent that leave you lost
I be the dominant force, similar to gravitation
Follow my course of navigation, we'll earn respect
And admiration of the population pump it on your station
A masked man came with the quick-fast game
With the kick-ass aim, and the plan for holdin big heads
Tryin to jump two spaces and beat two different cases
I been to many places so you know this is the time
So check the rhyme gallery, I earn the top salary
I go to battles, cause my rhymes is superfat with calorie
Watch the Grand blow up like The Nutty Professor
Tommy Hil' better see me with three mil', nothin less
From the days of James Brown up to Erykah Badu
Mass hysteria was nothin new, we put it down
In the midst of the abyss and likeness of God
Makin sure the course stays hard, yeah, what
Uhh, one time for my peoples that be lovin the rhyme 
We keep it bubblin, even in these troublin times 
And two times for my people who be givin support
Showin us love in this rap sport  
One time for my peoples that be lovin the rhyme
 We keep it bubblin, even in these troublin times
And two times for my people who be givin support
Showin us love in this rap sport
Uhh, one time for my peoples that be lovin the rhyme
 We keep it bubblin, even in these troublin times
And two times for my people who be givin support
Showin us love in this rap sport  
One time for my peoples that be lovin the rhyme
We keep it bubblin, even in these troublin times 
And two times for my people who be givin support
Showin us love in this rap sport
It's like that huh, what?
It's like that uhh, what?
Keep it goin now, what?
It's like that like that it's like that huh?
Uhh, Brand Nubian
Ninety-seven
Born's God, Born's God
Uhh, Brand Nubian, ninety-seven
Born's God, Born's GodSi ma folle fait on desespoir
Ne m'en veut pas
Je n'ai pas voulous te faire de tort
Si tu savais combien mes desirs me font suffrir
Ne m'en veut pas, je me debats contre ce sort
Chorus:
La musique est mon sweetest tabou
Malgre moi, elle se glisse entre nous
La musique, la musique est mon sweetest tabou
Mais mon tabou me rend trop egoiste
Comme un tempete
Elle envahit mon corps, mon etre
C'est un mystere, qui rend fous
Un univers, ou se condfond la nuit et le jour
Tout deviennent possible
C'est mon tabou
Chorus
Rap
J'ai tout fait pour y croire
Mais mon tabou me rend trop egoiste
Chaque jour sans toi, me rapelle
A ma douce folleIt's not a farway to go but a way to go
Come on, drift my way and then you'll you know
Then you'll know, then you'll know
It's not a farway to go but a way to go
Come on, drift my way and then you'll you know
Cause we've been bred, yes, to die
Teach me how to lie, bringing fears - why
Knowing deep this can't be the way you see
The way that's pure and we're feeling a cool breeze
I want to sail clean to where I'm going
Past the Milky Way only stars, souls controlling
Time to time you'll drift that way
Buy maybe it's a dream, but it's real to say
Contemplate problems scratching for traits
Just cutting the edge on TransReality Place
Do unto me as I do to you
Your Nubian cool do the do
Hype up direction
Work for perfection
What's your selection?
Call the soul connection
No fantasy to have to fill your mind
Running dip strips, prime time
Stop dreaming local, voice your vocal
Tally up the bill and get your total
It's not a farway to go but a way to go
Come on, drift my way and then you'll you know
Then you'll know, then you'll know
The mind races in places
Getting paid won't fade
Only black spades can't be caged
You disagree check my pedigree
What's my degree?
Mind moves with speed
Upping the ante, violins always handy
Trimmers, dilemmas and still standing
Vaped out on a different scene
Seems self-motivation, has no esteem
Drench me now activate plots loud
It won't work if a pot won't perk
All it will get is their feelings hurt
Direct to some chumps desk
Only fools are impressed at their guess
Journey leave a mess
Water leaves them wet
Terror reigns, when we're on the set
It's not a farway to go but a way to go
Come on, drift my way and then you'll you know
Then you'll know, then you'll know
Break the barbed wire on the mind
Here's a tip the yellow strip ripped off your spine
Fortified and packed with the truth that's stacked
Rap too black and further on back
To a place in grace where Nubians cradle
We rule the place
Party's over, I operate this sting
Canarys that sing we do 'em real mean
The drives are strong and aggressive
Cool type of thang, but objective
To a system that molds out misfits
Hitless, witless that try to snipe this
Skip to the M.O.B. and get hit quick
A primitive mind in a critical time
I'm buying time on the front line
Jaggered, taggered, madder not braggered
Ladder to a higher plateau but slowly
You'll glow, you've won the role
Entwined guts and spine, fine line
Between flesh and mind, prime time, truth, rhymes
Propagate signs in a critical time
Yeah!
This is the way to go dripping down your soul
Let the truth go face the truth and let it show9 intestable gratte la rime à la rage
Unda jusqu’au crayon, taille la mine à la hache
9 indivisible, les gars on est ensemble hein ?
MC on est en chien, ou même en sang, on est ensemble hein ?
9 incorruptible, mon âme n’est pas à vendre
Comme Sossa, on ne m’encule pas, mon trou de balle n’est pas à prendre
9 incorrigible, banlieusard
Pourquoi tu erres dans le square ? Je recherche la lumière dans le noir
Là t’es dans le 91 mec, des lascars en sapes
9 impec', des bails sales, 9 infecte
9 impossible, de nous la mettre, on fout la merde
On roule la verte négro, on garde toute sa tête
9 incroyable, des belles pompes, du beau brayage
Déboule à toute pompe s’il faut graille aille
9 imparable, on casse la baraque, c’est pas la Star Ac'
C’est le son que même les skateurs et les stars s’arrachent
9 impliqué, dans bien des tripes sales
Aux téléphones, on crée des codes, 9 indécryptable
C’est pour mes gars, 9 incarcérés
Que je déclare ces rimes, le cœur serré car c’est réel
9 intime quand c’est la famille
Draveil, Pris-Sud, cartel, c’est la famille
Capelo, Nice et Eto, ils sont en place mes négros
La Plank à la prod, bouge ta tête à tant casser les os
Ça vient d’une autre sphère, une haute sphère
9 invasion, si si, c’est pour nous-mêmes
Nouvelle atmosphère, tu rêves de ce qu’on ose faire
9 invasion, si si, c’est pour nous-mêmes
C’est magique, massif, classé dans les classiques
Tragique, boy ça va chiasser dans les calsifs
C’est ma street, ma zik
Qui manie le mic, fils ?
9 invasion, Nubi, c’est pour nous-mêmes
9 indélébile, on marque le biz, on marque le biz
Que tous les scarlas se le disent
On laisse des traces 9 impérissable
Comme des souvenirs d’enfance même si en France on est 9 indésirable
Pour la fraîche on est 9 inventifs
Mais c’est du taf 9 intensif, face aux keufs insensibles
Nous on se fout de ce qui est 9 interdit
Y aura du seum bien servi à moins que les 'steurs interviennent
La justice c’est 9 injuste
Nous on essaye de sauver nos seufs, rien de plus
Ils disent qu’on est 9 indécents
C’est vrai ici c’est grave, la cité crame, et même le bitume est 9 incandescent
Nous on rosse les 9 indics
Le bad boug sale on 9 insiste
Pas de poucave, la langue ça sert à rapper
À se lécher les doigts, pour compter les liasses
Ou prier de ne pas se faire attraper
Ça vient d’une autre sphère, une haute sphère
9 invasion, si si, c’est pour nous-mêmes
Nouvelle atmosphère, tu rêves de ce qu’on ose faire
9 invasion, si si, c’est pour nous-mêmes
C’est magique, massif, classé dans les classiques
Tragique, boy ça va chiasser dans les calsifs
C’est ma street, ma zik
Qui manie le mic, fils ?
9 invasion, Nubi, c’est pour nous-mêmes
Ma poésie est 9 inclassable
Ma boulimie de rimes est 9 insatiable
T’es le bienvenu ici, l’ambiance est chaude, l’accueil est glacial
Moi on m’a trop brisé le cœur, je suis devenu 9 incassable
Et puis 9 instable
Parce que je suis pauvre, mais talentueux à l’instar de plein de stars
C’est la tess que je 9 incarne
Voilà ma mission à chaque apparition, le 91 gagne 
Le 9 insoumis des bulles d’air à la casquette
Les keufs attrapent des ulcères, flanchent devant le casse-tête
Le lascar 9 intelligent
On n’escroque pas un escroc, on bluffe pas les dirigeants
Tu me suis, moi je me cantonne aux faits
Ici c’est speed, alors j’attache ma ceinture et je me cramponne au siège
Ça vient d’une autre sphère, une haute sphère
9 invasion, si si, c’est pour nous-mêmes
Nouvelle atmosphère, tu rêves de ce qu’on ose faire
9 invasion, si si, c’est pour nous-mêmes
C’est magique, massif, classé dans les classiques
Tragique, boy ça va chiasser dans les calsifs
C’est ma street, ma zik
Qui manie le mic, fils ?
9 invasion, Nubi, c’est pour nous-mêmes
