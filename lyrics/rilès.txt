Why I wanna stay when they all leave?
Should I smoke your alcohol or drink some weed?
Shit, I'm confused, what the fuck Imma sayin'?
On your pussy Imma go super sayan.. sayan!
Why I wanna stay when they all leave?
Should I smoke your alcohol or drink some weed?
Shit, I'm confused, what the fuck Imma sayin'?
On your pussy Imma go super sayan.. sayan!
Should I stay sober until the end?
Should I get wasted until my mind's erased?
Even though reality gon' slap me straight
It's hand might break got too many things in my head, my head!
Should I make a song, or should I make three more
Should I be the best, or should I be the one
Should I stand still, or should I, should I run
My left hand got the keys, but the other got a gun
Should I feel a doubt when I'm watching the news
Should I fuck with industry or should I refuse
Should I tell everybody I love, "I love you"
Should I wake my problems up or should I hit snooze
Why I wanna stay when they all leave?
Should I smoke your alcohol or drink some weed?
Shit, I'm confused, what the fuck Imma sayin'?
On your pussy Imma go super sayan.. sayan!
Do I really need to fuck her now?
My mind's tricking my body on Negrita
I know what I gotta do to make her cry
Should I stay tonight, or should I say goodbye, goodbye
Should I love this girl? no I won't even try
Should I feel ashamed? no, but should I feel proud
Would I be the same if I wasn't that high, nigga
Should I be earthbounded when my head's in the sky
Should I be generous if I wanna be liked
Should I be omnipresent to keep up this psych
Should I be the first, or should I be the last one
Should I fuck up the game, or should I win this fight..
Why I wanna stay when they all leave?
Should I smoke your alcohol or drink some weed?
Shit, I'm confused, what the fuck Imma sayin'?
On your pussy Imma go super sayan.. sayan!
Why I wanna stay when they all leave?
Should I smoke your alcohol or drink some weed?
Shit, I'm confused, what the fuck Imma sayin'?
On your pussy Imma go super sayan.. sayan!Thank God I can breathe, I can be what they can't buy
Even when I'm weak, I'm sure it's gon' be alright
Thank God I got home, I got food and I got y'all
Yes I will survive...
Thank God I can breathe, I can be what they can't buy
Even when I'm weak, I'm sure it's gon' be alright
Thank God I got home, I got food and I got y'all
Yes I will survive...
There will be highs, and lows... thank God I remain ok
How can I prove them how hourglasses drive me insane
And I'm amazed, when I think about how lucky I am
Not to wake up in a country full of bombings, killings, 'side of them I got no fucking problems
Glad you never tried to put me down
Oh too many times I did you wrong
Diggin' in my inner me
, then I found the enemies, how the fuck them niggas were too strong
And I kept those diamonds in my mind too long, no, they don't believe me 'cause I look too young
Keen everytime I see the beauty, bitter taste coming too quickly 'cause I'm always looking for what's wrong
Thank God I can breathe, I can be what they can't buy
Even when I'm weak, I'm sure it's gon' be alright
Thank God I got home, I got food and
I got y'all
Yes I will survive...
Thank God I can breathe, I can be what they can't buy
Even when I'm weak, I'm sure it's gon' be alright
Thank God I got home, I got food and I got y'all
Yes I will survive...
Survive...
Survive...
Survive...
Thank God I was dead, I came back three years ago
Body in the air, like they say it in these shows
You put me back in it, just to teach them what I know
Then I'll have to go
I gotta go, and see, all the shit that was in my mind
Thank God I do not live where Trump came after Obama
All my strength for the mamacitas, my brothers, sisters, never give up
Beginning of a new world that nobody wants, believe it or not I still do trust in us now
Yeah I know, I know, I know
Rose got thorns and I got a long way to go
Plus I told ya, ya, ya, ya, ya
No matter what happens we're never down, down, down
Thank God I can breathe, I can be what they can't buy
Even when I'm weak, I'm sure it's gon' be alright
Thank God I got home, I got food and I got y'all

Even when I'm weak, I'm sure it's gon' be alright
Thank God I got home, I got food and I got y'all
Yes I will survive...I came in this game like a motherfuckin' rat
Like I was starving for things I never thought I could have
I gave you all I got! Now you talk behind my back?
I ain't a time-philantropist anymore, what ?
You came to me like a little child
I brought you up, fed you and gave you all of my time
I taught you all I learned, lended you what I earned
Without me nah you ain't even a piece of shit, you turd
Yesterday we were brothers

Understand I'm no longer
Numb and my time ain't free
Yesterday we were brothers

You better not test, I am Gatsby, you're the guest. YES
Wanna snatch my dreams
Imma be your worst nightmare, yeah
Don't play with fire
Holy water's in my hands
And I don't care if you do, you don't, distinguish what I'm saying
Many meanings in my texts but I swear this shit no fiction

It will never be the same, nigga I will still be yelling!

Better have you degrees, masters!" Thinking that I go nowhere
But I don't wanna be no one, been working like a Trojan, man!
I know, you know, we know, Rilès is not the only one, yay
By myself I don't need your prod
I don't want your beef, your bitch and your buzz, always for my bros, my niggas, my blood
Never for the fuzz, they shootin' my cuz, I wanna bring the peace, but can I be bad?
This shit is for me, for you and for us, I do it for the streets, and for the suburbs
Plus I do it for the passion and I do it for the patience

Listen.. you're too crazy nigga
You better stop now
You better stop..
Let me tell you something;
When you dive into the wild
You can find death, you can find love
Better think about it twice
Cuz we all think, you gon' be gone
Listen I ain't going back
Look what I did, look what you've done
I guess I made the right choice
When I ventured in the Jungle
Listen I ain't going back
Look what I did, look what you've done
I guess I made the right choice
When I ventured in the Jungle
I'm 'bout to turn up every city
I do it for the real ones, real shit, real maafaka, hun
Lost 15lbs since the Rilèsundayz
Before I live like a king, gotta work like a slave
For the music, way, never lost, nah
Couple of months, Rilès on tour, yah
King in my city, ain't no debate now
Let me wipe all the bullshit they all left on the side
And I bounce when I feel it, master it then, done
I ain't from Miami, I ain't from the Westside
Coming from
R-city
, headed up to the Jungle
And you still think I'm mad..
Listen I ain't going back
Look what I did, look what you've done
I guess I made the right choice
When I ventured in the Jungle
Listen I ain't going back
Look what I did, look what you've done
I guess I made the right choice
When I ventured in the Jungle
Oh lord I need all your strengh
I need the time to get back in my palms
Oh lord I see all the snakes
I see the vipers
and I see them hoes
Oh lord I need all your strengh
I need the time to get back in my palms
Oh lord I see all the snakes
I see the vipers and I see them hoes
Now I can understand what he said;
"Welcome to the Jungle but you might lose yourself"
3 days no sleep and you think about death
"Rilès why you're getting pale?", "Why you're looking so strange?"
Don't worry 'bout me, it's all in the head
I'd better do it, it's all in the head
If I'm getting sick, it's all in the head
Welcome to the Jungle, it's all in the head..
So everyday Imma still bounce when I feel it, master it then, done
I ain't from Miami, I ain't from the Westside
Coming from R-city, headed up to the wild
And you still think I'm mad..
Listen I ain't going back
Look what I did, look what you've done
I guess I made the right choice
When I ventured in the Jungle
Listen I ain't going back
Look what I did, look what you've done
I guess I made the right choice
When I ventured in the Jungle
Oh now I ain't going back
Look what I did, look what you've done
Yes  I made the right choice
When I ventured in the Jungle
Oh now I ain't going back
Look what I did, look what you've done
Yes  I made the right choice
When I ventured in the JungleListen up, you got a problem man
Baby you’ve been on my mind
Baby you’re wasting my time
Lotta pressure on my name
Lotta worries in my head
Lotta responsibilities, traps & threats
I canalize, no I won’t break
Down at night alone with myself
With my demons and my pain
Maybe if I blow some trees and see that bitch it’ll make all that shit fade away
Don’t get distracted
Pleasure is not happiness, stop running away from reality
Baby you’ve been on my mind
So let me smoke
Weed every night
Last night I gave up and did it again
I tricked my mind to forget
Baby you’ve been on my mind
Baby you’re wasting my time
Baby you’ve been on my mind
Baby you’re wasting my timeI spent
One entire week without any rest
Without getting out of my room I know it’s all in the head
Always perfecting my craft
I’m not that far from the best
I understood the more you do
The better you know yourself
I understood the mind is bigger than the whole universe
I understood I was afraid of failure, ‘till I got hurt
I understood that being rich was more of a state of mind
And I won’t ever be happy with money, ‘till it buys time
Aside of that, everything marvelous
I level up, more follow us
They fear me now I’m lifting up
You’re hating when they’re loving us
Family first, I still assert
No fraud involved in none of us
I already knew that before the wave was taking off
And Imma die for my niggas, they know
Imma still be there, even when I'll take off
I don’t trust nobody cuz my body’s enough
Really understood a lot from the last several months
Imma imma die for my niggas, they know
Imma still be there, even when I’ll take off
Not feeling impressed by millions anymore
Really understood a lot from the last several months
Don’t ever, ever leave your door opened
Weird niggas tried breaking in and steal at fucking 3 A.M
Gotta protect Mom and my sister before they face a gun
I met death twice
Don’t worry I can meet it again
Don’t ever ever let somebody say
“You can't make a music video without a damn budget”
‘Brothers’, 40$
10 million and zero marketing
Yes I came in this game like a motherfucking rat I said
Don’t ever give a fuck about cats on the internet
Starving for attention but your screen is not paying your bills
You work at a shitty job and your gently hating yourself
So when you go back home
Holler at me if it cuts your pain
But the best I understood
Was I don’t need validation
I’ve been waiting for them blogs
‘Till I found out it’s all made up
Negotiating everything
Paying for a piece of paper?
Making waves in my country
Yet I still got 0 portrait
Something you should know
And I got examples
Everybody was surprised after
SEB’s support
I had 50 songs out and music videos
And everybody was like
“Why I never heard ‘bout you?”
Man..
Die for my niggas, they know
Imma still be there, even when I’ll take off
I don’t trust nobody cuz my body’s enough
Really understood a lot from the last several months
Imma imma die for my niggas, they know
Imma still be there, even when I’ll take off
Not feeling impressed by millions anymore
Really understood a lot from the last several months
I can understand, it’s on my way
I did understand, it’s on my way
I did understand there’s something wrong
Will it end up badly like it should?
I did understand, I can’t go back
So let me dare before I gotta die
Imma die for my niggas, they know
Imma still be there, even when I’ll take off
I don’t trust nobody cuz my body’s enough
Really understood a lot from the last several months
Imma immma die for my niggas, they know
Imma still be there, even when I’ll take off
Not feeling impressed by millions anymore
Really understood a lot from the last several monthsMan I don't know what is so wrong with me
My time’s always running will I ever stop it
Nah I don't know what's
the 3ein
on me
Me against the clock I really try my hardest
Nah I don’t know what is so wrong with me
My time's always running will I ever stop it
Nah I don't know what's the 3ein on me
Me against the clock I really try my hardest
And I don't know what the fuck's so wrong
Wasn't ready for the downfall on my own
Should've never talked about it in my songs
You’re solo when you’re so low, so everything slows down
I'm here and there no I never stay
In the stud, I should’ve been today
Why the fuck got the cam in my hand?
I do your job cuz you cannot do shit
And it's like;
“Wow” everywhere I go
“Don't make them videos
You waste your force, use it for your flow
Your music and your shows”
But listen bro, I cannot trust yo
Yo lazy motherfuck, I needed help
No pesos, you made it clear my problems ain't yours
Nah I don’t know what is so wrong with me
My time's always running will I ever stop it
Nah I don't know what's the 3ein on me
Me against the clock I really try my hardest
Lost and Found then
Many traps on my way
I've been escaping the desert
Not my faith
No, I don't care bro
‘Bout all the money, fame and clothes
It's not the point, of what I live for
Where's the joy, was it my choice?
Will I do what I'm I supposed to?
It ain't just words
Pendulum still runs for my soul
Man I don't know what is so wrong with me
My time's always running will I ever stop it
Nah I don't know what's the 3ein on me
Me against the clock I really try my hardest
Nah I don't know what is so wrong with me
My time's always running will I ever stop it
Nah I don't know what's the 3ein on me
Me against the clock I really try my hardestHistory repeats itself
With the blood and with the hate
I don’t like to see that face
When you say once again
Que será, será
 Noche pasará
Sin importar que llores o te rías
Que será, será
 Noche pasará
Sin importar que te mueras o vivas
Oh
You lose faith and faith is losing you
Your love faints under hate’s uppercut
You keep on singing the same old song
Once again you’re throwing bits of hope
History repeats itself
With the blood and with the hate
I don’t like to see that face
When you say once again
I finessed the proof
And it’s the truth
Your try for peace is just a vain
Attempt to dilute the hate, the rage, the pain, the pill
The people track & try to cheat
Cuz I traveled all around the fear
Defended flaws and feels
Followed the foolish way
Now freedom’s so dumb
I don’t believe in nothing but the bitter taste of yesterday
Yeah the hopeless song
Is swiping strong
Cuz nothing changed
And nothing won’t
We think we care
Indeed we don’t
We gon’ forget and swap the same mistake
‘em dollars, add them genres
Races, religions
Perks and burdens
Pride to worsen
Worships, words to dust
And there’s the world I’m watchin'
Que será, será
 Noche pasará
Sin importar que llores o te rías
Que será, será
 Noche pasará
Sin importar que te mueras o vivas
Oh
You lose faith and faith is losing you
Your love faints under hate’s uppercut
You keep on singing the same old song
Once again you’re throwing bits of hope
Tell me, oh tell me
Why’re you not leaving this world?
If it is so fuckin bad
Let me handle you the gun
And
Now you’re looking down
Triggers shutting many mouths
Focused on the bad
When shit goes down you switch your mind up
Your philosophy is oh so fake
Innocent and guilty ‘front my face
Fatalistic, son you fake a self
Tearing feelings down so you’re feeling high
Colorblind like Logan it’s ok
Golden tissue to cry it’s ok
And you talk the most
Just to say the less
Next time keep that grief
To your fucking self
Que será, será
 Noche pasará
Sin importar que llores o te rías
Que será, será
 Noche pasará
Sin importar que te mueras o vivas
Oh
You lose faith and faith is losing you
Your love faints under hate’s uppercut
You keep on singing the same old song
Once again you’re throwing bits of hope
I told you “let us dare”, no matter what
Fugit tempus
This ain’t no fantasy, nah it’s my life
Hallelujahs
You know the hair, the fire, the boy, the style
Djazaïrias
I’d be a millionaire if my account
Was in Dinars
And you see, they all shake
When a jigga like me breaks
The industry suddenly st-t-tutter
Back to back to LA
Heading to the VMAs
Imma see those imma m-m-murder
But ain’t no pimpin’
Money savin’
Jigga said I gotta save it and invest it latter
Ain’t no great win
Without great pain
That’s why I’m pushing my body to the limits, furtherI ain’t got no one to fear
I ain’t impressed anymore
I don’t see but I feel
Sour energy brought me there
Search into you and the paper’s gon fill up itself
So fuck if you curse when I flex
Fuck I’m not kind and stupid, better serve me respect
I think I’m good at feeling bad
Don’t be too nice when scavengers are ready to bounce
I picture plans in my head
Darker than
Dinka
Venom pushing up my edges
I won’t let dirt on my name
Do it for fun
‘Front of me bitch you bargain
I ain’t got a lot to sing
Still alive just for the hate that I hate, bitch
You gon’ remember the name
Jungle ain’t shit when you’re beaten all over again
Smoking the shine in my eyes and I’m left with some apeshit Enlighten but thoughts are the darkest
Wildin’ everywhere but in the jungle
Come to
R city
we ‘bout to fuck the freckles off your face-
-in you flaws you don’t wanna, wanna
Racing against myself faster, faster
If I slow down it’s the ganja, ganja
If I fuck up it’s the karma, karma
No tears falling down my eyes
No fear left into my mind
All this Evil turned me blind
I need to run towards the light
No tears falling down my eyes
No fear left into my mind
All this Evil turned me blind
I need to run towards the light
Promise me you won't be falling
Say to me you are my greatest opponent
I keep the backbone solid
Tahia Djazaïr
Baba
grew up in the sand and the mountains
Fuck what you heard If you hear what you're saying
Didn't like my song
You said "this shit's amazing"
I'm tired of the Yes-men
I'm tired of the Yasminas
Tired of the elephantshit I see
Ouhh skibidibam
Back in her pussy It has been while 
Ouh shaking new hands
Fucking new bitches and making new songs (

)
Ouhh back and I run
Feel like my libido me never done
Why you keep on running when your legs already broken?
Now I'm putting down the
'juana
Back to the
hagra
Is you really? I said kinda
Pray that my sins never come back
Bypass the drama
Look ain't no blood on my contracts
And Imma dance like a warrior
Salam hyenas
You cannot switch off the phoenix
This ain't no threat but my simple statement
Welcome to the jungle
Rilès vs Satan
No tears falling down my eyes
No fear left into my mind
All this Evil turned me blind
I need to run towards the light
No tears falling down my eyes
No fear left into my mind
All this Evil turned me blind
I need to run towards the lightAnayanadiyanadanada

And now we kicking with the pros

Never gone if I'm leaving-
Keep on going if I go away
Bitches n yamz

Ser to my sins
Lotta despair
Many mistakes
In my defence
Skippin' that love
As if it was hitting my legs

Hey wallah blessings come when I'm diving in
213 calling, yema, fam, feeling great
If I don't quit here, that means I'll never quitWhat I want's what you want
This bitch is my reflection
I swear I’m shocked I can't even find my words
This is it
You're just what I need
And when we fuck rough it feels like a dream
Solitary on a Friday
Starving now I need some peaches
Hmhmhm
Looking in the cards I flip
Nothing really find for me
Hmhmhmhm
Maybe I am not that hungry
Maybe it’s a trap full of lust and envy
I won't fall in it
Rilès you already did
Put the phone down
Open reason
Go for a run
But please do not touch and smoke your drogas, drogas
I'm too weak so I roll a big one, big one
Then I trip and I keep on scrollin down, scroll down
I say "bye my ethic" I'm so dumb, so dumb, hun
She pick up the phone
I pick up my weed
And my lust
And my greed
And the others sins
I don't wanna talk
I just wanna feel
Not aware of tonight's true insanity
What I want's what you want
This bitch is my reflection
I swear I'm shocked I can’t even find my words
This is it
You’re just what I need
And when we fuck rough it feels like a dream
Knock knock
"Who's there?"
"It’s the Sheitan motherfucker let's play"
She already naked
And she feeling really really thirsty wow
Looking like a model nothing like them hoes
Waking up the savage in me, can't control
Let me put all of my pain down in your pussy
With my pace I wish you will endure like nobody did
Ouh, damn
She a savage
Pull on her horns like she was the villain
And we fucking and banging and banging and fucking and fucking and fucking and banging and fucking like
Wow!
I can't believe what we did
Was it fake or was it real ? 
She feeling like I’m a star
She feeling my energy
Sin by sin
One by one
I'm finally back home
But I want a second round
For my first time in heaven
Sin by sin
One by one
It's minutes before dawn
So I call her back again
What I want's what you want
This bitch is my reflection
I swear I'm shocked I can't even find my words
This is it
You're just what I need
And when we fuck rough it feels like a dream
Jump back in the car like a fool
Guided by my thirst and my flute
The scene is the same at the door
She even wilder than before
She rippin' my polo
Grind on my torso
She ain't looking like she be clean tho
I saw the evil on her face
Yet I
Did her like I never did
On the sofa, the floor and the kingsize bed
Up and down and from behind she did that split
Better than movies, realer than fantasies
But, I looked into them eyes it was all blank and bleak
"Hey what happened? We're not finished
Why you rushing in the kitchen?"
Then she comes back
I say "whats'up"
She said
"You're never gonna leave"
Goddamn
She got a knife and she smiles at me
Ayahuasca she told me she drank
I think she lost her mind
I think I noticed it
I slept with the Evil, it just looks like
What I want's what you want
This bitch is my reflection
I swear I'm shocked I can't even find my words
This is it
You're just what I need
And when we fuck rough it feels like a dreamÉ a verdade que me leva
É a verdade que me leva
Perdoa minha alma, meu amor
Na 'scuridão ainda eu 'tou
É a verdade que me leva
É a verdade que me leva
Perdoa minha alma, meu amor
De fingir me desanimou
Andalé, Andalé
Sun slowly slept away
Didn't have nowhere to go but down
That life wasn't up to me
I wish being sad was just a trend I wish I could start again
I wish on the inside would be more than just a man
É a verdade que me leva
É a verdade que me leva
Perdoa minha alma, meu amor
Na 'scuridão ainda eu 'touShe said 'I still love you'
I still send you letters
I'm not reading your words
So why you love me better?
She said 'I still love you'
I still send you flowers
But the perfume I knew
Now don't really matter
Don't wanna be friends tho
After all the shit I did along the line
Just wanna be real now 
Was a poison for you with the sweetest lies
I just wanna be real now
You were the first with the real love
But I torn it up
And ruined it like I wanted
Yeah I lied to you and me
Rose
The petal and the moth
The victim and the cause
I did my best to do the worst
And repeat when you're
Gone
Close and yet alone
Love or just a joke
I cannot feel more wrong
When I see sequels
She said 'I still love you'
I still send you letters
I'm not reading your words
So why you love me better
She said 'I still love you'
I still send you flowers
But the perfume I knew
Know don't really matter
Trust my sense
I can feel your self
I don't want your sex
I just want, you, sane
Keep on lyin'
And with no regrets
Messin with the fakes
In a year you dead, oh
You really playing with the evil
Though you feel it in your stomach
For a second, you stare at your case
After a minute you just in it
Forgetting the past and present
Losin' yourself in fake happiness
Rose
The petal and the moth
The victim and the cause
I did my best to do the worst
And repeat when you're
Gone
Close and yet alone
Love or just a joke
I cannot feel more wrong
Wrong, wrong
She said 'I still love you'
I still send you letters
I'm not reading your words
So why you love me better
She said 'I still love you'
I still send you flowers
But the perfume I knew
Now don't really matterBlood on my lips I'm so hungry I'm 'bout to kill them all
Tears on your cheek, bitch you thristy and I'm your waterfall

4 years in the shadow they were blind out, I thought I would never see the light bruh
Now you can finally wake the fuck up, Rachid, Laura, tell me how you feel now
Always chasing you for just a paper, got love for you but you could've been first
Pushed me to the edge but never gave up, 'least I learned to never ever trust Trust
I can feel the change is real, I can feel you won't be me
I can feel these niggas 'round me, just want to be famous, still looking for their skils

Ya, ya, ya, you can't tell me nothing, nobody talked 'bout that shit as I ain't got a deal
And never took my songs seriously cuz I'm recording bedside my bed
And now they're all surprised to discover my name, fuck you, fuck the game
Fuck all your songs, fuck your fame, fuck, I'm wise enough to know the buzz will end
Thank you for the love but I've been used to pain, I cannot go out cuz I got songs to make
That shit is my life, for you it's just a phase, yes I got more hits, you're not ready for them
Yes I got more beats, than I got problems, when I'm done with it, get back to the paint
Thought I would end up like Gogh
, but God said : "Wait, nigga better stay, remember what I said"

Enjoy the ride, it's gon' be longI got a thousand in my pockets
Paying drinks for everyone
Cabs on cabs, hands on hands
Long days, short nights
On the run
I’m not paying the hotel room
And I wanna see Sarah
Smoking blunts in the hotel room
Watching Rick and Morty high
I’m thinking
You don’t really know what you’ve been doing lately
I should focus more on finding who’s the real me
You don’t really show how you’ve been feeling
Something you’ve been working on
But it’s not always working out
Out of this world
But inside of my mind
I do everything I can to walk on the tightrope
Stuck in a paradox
One day I love you
The next day I’m chasing after them like Byron
I can’t fuck you cuz you’re way too beautiful
Beautiful
I don’t love you but I wish I could make love to you
All night long
I got a thousand in my pockets
Paying drinks for everyone
Cabs on cabs, hands on hands
Long days, short nights
On the run
I’m thinking
You don’t really know what you’ve been doing lately
I should focus more on finding who’s the real me
You don’t really show how you’ve been feeling
Something you’ve been working on
But it’s not always working out
Another day
Another chance to fuck up this whole game
Another day
Another shot to shut their mouth open
Another day
Another hatin’ ass bitch on my way
Another day
Another dilemma rockin’ brown hair
Ok, ok, ok
I play with sirens, but this one’s different
We don’t text that much as I’m busy
She knows music’s fueling my silence
I’m not supposed to do what I’m doing
Will I ever give a fuck ‘bout some
Truth been lying ‘bout my direction
It’s gon backfire on my dumb front
I got a thousand in my pockets
Paying drinks for everyone
Cabs on cabs, hands on hands
Long days, short nights
On the run
I’m thinking
 x2
You don’t really know what you’ve been doing lately
I should focus more on finding who’s the real me
You don’t really show how you’ve been feeling
Something you’ve been working on
But it’s not always working
You don’t really know what you’ve been doing lately
I should focus more on finding who’s the real me
You don’t really show how you’ve been feeling
Something you’ve been working on
But it’s not always working out[Intro:  Tommy Genesis &

Mouth workin' it
With no collagen

Bitch, why you wanna love me?
10 months ago you were betting my defeat
Thinking I was too crazy for the shit that I'm in
Now you're sendin' me snaps of you and your tities
Talking to me like "Wassup, wassup, wassup Rilès!
I need an instrumental, can I record my text?"
They wanna be friends, personnal interest
But my hustle ain't free, and my talent is less
Wanna be me, they don't fuck with themselves
Wanna beat me , yeah I've tried but I failed
Trust me :
"Whaat? He French, he rappin' in English?
Who the fuck he is, what is this?" And I say:
Ohmamama, Ooohmamama..
Ohmamama, Ooohmamama..
Ohmamama, Ooohmamama..
Ohmamama, Ooohmamama..
Haters, turning into friends
And friends turn into enemies
Problems come along with the fame
And It's just the beginning
If you see me less
It's 'cause that I'm doing more
I'm different I don't need your labels
Move on, I don't waste time anymore, no more..
Bitch niggas sayin' "it's luck"
I'm making it worth 'cause I'm putting in work
'Fore I be the best, I was probably the worst
Gotta thank all of your wack rappers raising my thrist
Saying shit like "Listen, listen, listen I know"
But you know the least, why you're talking the most?
Afraid of my dreams cuz you gave up on yours
So go talk to my advisor if it is for
pesos
,
hmar..
"Whaat? He rap, he produces and mix?
Who the fuck he is, what is this?" And I say:
Ohmamama, Ooohmamama..
Ohmamama, Ooohmamama..
Ohmamama, Ooohmamama..
Ohmamama, Ooohmamama..
Ohmamama, Ooohmamama..
Ohmamama, Ooohmamama..
Ohmamama, Ooohmamama..
Ohmamama, Ooohmamama..Help me Lord
I won’t do this all alone
I say welcome to the motherfuckin’
Jungle
, man
Where hopes and dreams feel bittersweet once you bath in it
Me? Let me swim in ignorance, you wanna win
How the fuck did I end up with scars all on my wrist?
Damn
I wanna be like the ones that I praise
What’s the price to pay?
Lil’ boy wanna play with the Timbs and the Ye’s
He’s so blind, he’s so passionate, he’s in his haste
Life is so beautiful when you fight for your dreams
Didn’t know me, begging for help
You can’t do shit so all on myself
You ain’t got time
You ain’t got skills
Or you don’t really want to cuz me no got no bread
Damn
I wanna be blind again
Unfold my soul to the only thing I’m good at
And believe in utopias without crashing in pain
‘Cause I had no money in my pockets
But my head was full of them dreams
I thought I knew the story
Goddamn the real one’s far too mean
I had no money in my pockets
But my head was full of them dreams
So help me Lord
It’s time again
I run like I never did
Yema say!
Oohh, oohh
Oohh, oohh
He just wanna be like nobody else
He just wanna be loved for what he is
Fuck up the game, ‘fore you fuck up like this
Better do what you said, if you say what you think
Pull up in the race
They don’t want to see you win
Depending on nobody but I’m enslaved to my sins
I’ll never be the same
Never really knew myself
It’s- It’s a marathon
Do I do know when it will end ?
Oh
Which one do you wish for me, bish
“Why do you preach for?”
“Please never switch, you a real one!”
Rich boy, will he rejoin what he reached for?
Still fresh out the Sheol, wasn’t shit tho
Damn
Ready or not
You and your soul will be introduced into the Jungle
You will never go back and every choice you’ve ever made now belongs to the past
So far it has been a long and winding road but you’re still miles and miles away from your final destination
All the blood, sweat and tears you shed
All the sacrifices you’ve made were premises of your own journey
Your psyche is now weaker than ever, but your mind was built never to fall apart
You will trust the
Maktub
and the time that has been given back to you
And without further ado
WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE
Oohh, oohh
Oohh, oohh
Welcome to the jungleIt's been a while, shit I missed the rehab,
psyche
was gone
Ain't no room for rest when demons whisper "We should've won
"
Ain't no room for miseria when you got all you want
You think I'm back at it, guess what ya
Hmar
, never been gone
Hey mama don't worry no more
Made 100k just from the store
Another million to record
The
bailiff
's daughters at my shows
I'm twice as blessed as I'm ignored
I need less but I want more
I still do my shit alone, 'cause alone is way too much
And they say
What the fuck is on? Who the fuck is in?
Where the hell you at? Where the hell you been?
Who the fuck is she? Who you dealing with?
Rilès back at it, Rilès never left
Do you want to leave 'em hating?
Or do you want to elevate 'em?
Do you want to keep the paving?
Boy you better not lose your patience
Dissed by nation, 'cause it's the fashion
But time's gon make all it's sense
I can do my shit alone, 'cause we're many in my head
September I finished it
November on the scene
Till December I built the entire store and made the prints
Enero
till April busy directing and cutting clips
GH5,
CS6
Lost some time but it's on fleek
Face to face you ain't gon' do shit
'Cause of course it's the internet
From all the letters I did receive
No one had the guts to come at my face
Niggas play roles
Niggas do flex
Niggas sell weed just to buy a street cred
So eat my balls
Suck another dick
And try to find yourself
Didn't buy a car, I bought a lens
DIdn't buy a chain,
I bought a MX with a RED
DIdn't buy to flex
I'm better spending all I got to invest in my craft
And triple-double all the blessings from my gains
It's all on me, if you talk 'bout bread
It's all on me, ain't no swank, don't sweat
It's all on me, 'cause it began like we
Only figures flip, no I didn't change
And they say;
What the fuck is on? Who the fuck is in?
Where the hell you at? Where the hell you been?
Who the fuck is she?
Who you dealing with?
Rilès back at it, Rilès never left
Why you mad? What you mean?
Pussy feelings
Why you moan? What you feel?
When your ear me
Why you stalk?
Why you here?
Why you talk?
Is it fear?
What's your life?
Probably som' sad and no worth so
Which one do you wish for me, bish
Why do you preach for?
"Please never switch you a real one!"
Rich boy, will he rejoin what he reached for?
Still fresh out the sheol, wasn't shit tho
Damn damn, goddamn
Damn, goddamn, goddamn
Damn damn, goddamn
Damn, goddamn, goddamnOuh girl
I don't wanna talk with you
I just wanna fuck, fuck, fuck
I know you too
Ouh girl
Now it's all about the truth
We just want to fuck, fuck, fuck
Until we swoon
Don't look at me with them eyes
Feels like you're touching me
You play with my weaknesses
Let me play with your clit
I love your dress
I love that look
And I love your lips
Don't say too much
I'd rather hear you moan in my ear
Away from prying eyes
You put your hands on my dick
You pinch your lips
I touch your peach
You call me 'daddy'
Temptation at its highest
Feels like I'm giving in
Take off that dress
Get on me girl
You won't regret
Ouh girl
I don't wanna talk with you
I just wanna fuck, fuck, fuck
I know you too
Ouh girl
Now it's all about the truth
We just want to fuck, fuck, fuck
Until we swoon
Don't care where you from
What you did
Or what you study
But if it is the only way for me to get in
Don't care 'bout your diet
If you're vegan or glut-free
Mine's all about eating every inch of your pussy
Deep down
I know you're feeling it
Desire
Rising between your legs
Let me
Take a sip and drown
Ouh girl
I don't wanna talk with you
I just wanna fuck, fuck, fuck
I know you too
Ouh girl
Now it's all about the truth
We just want to fuck, fuck, fuck
Untill we swoon
My lips on yours
Us on cloud 9
We ain't getting off
On me you get down
Never stop
I like the way you dance
, and
Love how you dare
When You say my name
Ouh girl
I don't wanna talk with you
I just wanna fuck, fuck, fuck
I know you too
Ouh girl
Now it's all about the truth
We just want to fuck, fuck, fuck
Until we swoon
Ouh girl
I don't want to talk with you
I won't need no words
When I'll feel your touch
When we'll be as oneI think Imma do it
Just myself and the sea
I think Imma do it
Need no one
I think Imma do it
Just myself and the sea
I think Imma do it
Need no one
Why you believe in something
If it brought skeletons
You was made to win
You was optimist
Now it feels like you're done
They envy where you sittin’
Seat ain't sweet
Seat is rough
Back to back it's the same old fight
They gon’ eat you live till' you front
I will fight the vision
But the vision is so clear
Feeding my soul with my sins
I'm choosing my life for the ending
I think Imma do it
Just myself and the sea
I think Imma do it
Need no one
I think Imma do it
Just myself and the sea
I think Imma do it
Need no one
I wish sometimes I'd be dumb
I wish I walked more than run
And if I'm meant to be numb
At least I did what they can't
She feed me good, she my sun
She know I ain't a bad man
When everybody had a condescending picture of my psyche
It's all love and she knew it first
Bad man, bad man
Don’t forgive me when I’m-
Dead n gone
That's fine, that’s fine
It ain't your fault, nah
It's mine, it's mine
I will fight the vision
But the vision is so clear
Feeding my soul with my sins
I’m choosing my life for the ending
I think Imma do it
Just myself and the sea
I think Imma do it
Need no one
I think Imma do it
Just myself and the sea
I think Imma do it
Need no one
If I ever leave
Pretend I didn't
I'm still living, breathing
In your eardrum
I'm just waiting for you in the next room
Baba don't cry
I know you're more than strong
Don't ever change your tone
When you'll talk bout' your son
I love you so much
I'm so sorry
I think imma do it
Just myself and the sea
I think imma do it
Need no one
I think imma do it
Just myself and the sea
I think imma do it
Need no oneMike Mixer is in the bulding

Gave her flowers, ten grams
Feel like Pablo

Just to try to know you
Hyped up, smoking in the street like it's legal
Hyped up, bitches on my thumb like I'm Scott Storch
Hyped up, get the fuck out of Hell no more sad songs

Bellek aux losas Tell me what's your spell
I love the way you dance
Yes, I'm faded with my friends
We love the way you sing
Back the fuck up, slow the fuck down, I cannot be insane
She told me "Don't fall in the trap", it's too late, tie me to the pole, I won't ever do what I did
Right cannot feel my eyes, my ears, nor my self, swimming in a ocean full of blood and my tears
Tell me where the hell has gone my good sense, my feels, if I do it, I did it, Imma do it again 
Ya know, it's up to you, amaze me's what you do
Sex and singing in tune, sirens coming for you
I know, it's up to me, nervous, why am I watching?

The pain will feel ok
Why you resist? You can feel free, finally taste what you seek
She told me to fall in her arms 'fore I knee, beggin' my niggas to let me run to her sheets
Right now cannot feel my eyes, my ears, but them lips, if I'm neither drunk or high, what the hell is this?
Splatting colors in a place that seemed dull & dim, then you forget that you're drowning deep and indeed 
Ya know, it's up to you, amaze me's what you do
Sex and singing in tune, sirens coming for you
I know, it's up to me, nervous, why am I watching?

We love the way you singWhere should I start? Or where should I go?
To every motherfucker who only saw my past job
Was a monitor for less than a year, 4 days a month
My real job was selling paintings,
to build where I record
I ain’t a novice, you might see me as new in you lane
Just 'cuz I had no exposure don't mean I can’t son the game
Shoutout to SEB who started the fire cuz it’s really real
The papers gon’ ignore your existence, less you got a deal
Yeah, yeah I already said it, fuck they didn’t believe my vision
Let me tell you more ‘bout my trip,
tho you won’t get every pieces
So.. why you rapping in English? I started when I was 14
I had to hide from my parents that I sang and began writing
Cuz it is all about the studies, music is buffooneries
They did many sacrifices from Algeria to Paris
I did try to write in French, my BIC was freezing
Wanted to.. Rap out loud… But didn’t want to share it
So I wrote it in a language they didn’t know
My thoughts, my emotions, joys and troubles undercov’
My early bars were shit, but for my friends I was like Hov’
So I gradually took it seriously,
and had bigger goals yet..
..Needed to improve myself, my weakness had to be strength
Made a choice they didn’t fuck with,
went to college for my verses
Studied the English language and literature for 3 years
From Shakespeare to Hemingway
,
but it wasn’t for the B.A
Aside of that I had no dineros
Only my devotion and faith for what I had to show
I spent my whole scholarship on stuff for the studio
Always buying second-hand, the grid of my mic is still broke
But I learned to take the less and made better than the most
4 a.m. for a preamp, in his Saxo baba drove
Me To Paris, it was worth it, as I bought it for 4
Hundred dollars less than what the original really cost
Give me my money, money back I’m on a rush man
My bullets going straight they never swoosh man
I was in Paris for that money ‘bout a preamp
Also for a freestyle, but that’s behind me
Now that I had all in my hands
It was ‘bout engineering
Alone with the internet
Had no teacher for that shit
And then I schooled the game up, shut the fuck up
What’s a fancy studio, when you can’t rap
Had no song in advance, nothing was planned
I just spent this whole year double turned in my bedroom, shit
Now it’s ‘bout million dollar deals, still at Mama’s crib
In less than a year, learned the same as if it equaled 10
With knives under my throat, I discovered more than I wished for
You can’t match the grind but you can kiss my...
Ok, ok, it’s cool you spoke about your grind and your struggle
It’s crazy you made it that far, but you forgot ‘bout a puzzle
In every song you’re teasing, talking shit we couldn't understand
Was It really deeper than that or bullshit you told & pretend, huh?
You should've talked about it!
Yes, I’m late and it’s because of this ending
I rewrote it 30 times to finally burn them sheets
Everything was ready, except for my spirit
And as it’s stronger than myself
, I ain’t got the guts for it
Last Sunday, it was done, but I messed my week
I was thinking way too much for 5 days I lost sleep
Should I say everything or should I keep hiding?
For my own sanity I surrendered to silence
In some way, I spoke to somebody and learned something
In some way, my addiction about time's for a reason
In some way, I was supposed to leave but didn’t finish
In some way I was afraid y’all think it’s just madness
In some way, it started when I saw my own being
In some way, I’m hiding elements since 2014
In some way, I’m still preparing for the Grand Final
Now let me give y’all half a clue about the whole puzzle..In spite of all their warnings
I know what I have to do, and I know I have to do it
Because the universe is by my side, and I'm not afraid to get hurt
As I am a punching bag ready to embrace defeat and disappointment
The pain of regret is something I'll never know
Because while a lot of people are governed by their fears and habits
I, am governed by my heart, and my dreams..
BANG
How can he beat the game? How can he spit them flames?
How can he dare go solo? nah, man he's insane..
How can he make them beats? How can he do the mix?
How can he do shit on his own? man, tell me..
Listen, Imma prove they were all wrong
When they told me all these dreams won't last long
Time is running soon I'll be dead and gone
So fuck outta here I'd rather walk alone
Yeah, yeah, war ready, better watch your back
Right now, oh, many corny, fakes and wack
Rappers, I'm 'bout to fuck this game no hack
Watch out I'm back, watch out I'm back, back, back..
How can he never quit? How can he be the shit?
How can he do the trick with these weekly classics?
Yes, Imma fuck them all, yes, Imma give'em raw
No, I ain't got 30 dudes behind my songs
Because I learned everything from scratch
In my bedroom everyday, everynight
I was enclosed while you were having fun
Window shutters I must not see the sun
Until I finished mastering the song
Pro Tools is cracked so this shit takes too long
Ok, I'm done, let's get back to Reason
Five beats a day for the whole summer long, long, lonnngg
After the darkness will come the sun
Mama don't worry I got you now
Pendulum still running for my life
Imma prove them, then away I'll fly
I'll be the rising sun
I'll be the clouds and I'll be the dust
Pendulum finally took me down
But I proved them, now away I flyOh
Oh yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Bring chance
Stack bands 
Hard hand, understand 
Sick genes
All in the head 
Study the game
I get in the game 
With me love so
Now she want it groovy, like she Coco, ah-ha-ha
I keep it sexy
Now she want it wavy like she Brandy
If you know, I care 'bout you
If you go, I'll fall asleep
If you pave the way I do
Take my heart, don't fuck it in
Baby wanna slap it on the floor 
She got me dizzy, I'm like "Damn, she want some more" 
I'm like "Oh my God, she take it back and forth" 
This shit got me fellin' like I'm fallin' off 
Baby wanna slap it on the floor 
She got me dizzy, I'm like "Damn, she want some more" 
I'm like "Oh my God, she take it back and forth" 
This shit got me fellin' like I'm fallin' off 
Since I quit the 3ein away
I guess, the finesse was upon my faith
Ballin' on and on, is great, with my chicharita
New race to the bank 
Right post, got the pic 
Two phones, no friends, ayy
Flate, flate, flate, trips
Same stones to my wrist
Right bench, wrong lift
If you know, I care 'bout you
If you go, I'll fall asleep
If you pave the way I do
Take my heart, don't fuck it in
Baby wanna slap it on the floor
She got me dizzy, I'm like "Damn, she want some more"
I'm like "Oh my God, she take it back and forth"
This shit got me fellin' like I'm fallin' off
Baby wanna slap it on the floor
She got me dizzy, I'm like "Damn, she want some more"
I'm like "Oh my God, she take it back and forth"
This shit got me fellin' like I'm fallin' off
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-ohBang, bang, bang
She fucked it up
She stole my heart
But she rose my soul, my soul
She rose my soul, listen babe
Bang, bang, bang
She fucked it up
She stole my heart
But she rose my soul, my soul
She rose my soul, let me say
Hey
What you've done?
Look at me
Look at me now
I guess I shouldn't make a song for you
Why the fuck I felt like at home with you?
But sometimes home ain't 'bout 4 walls
It's just two eyes and a heartbeat
And you fucked it up on your own, don't ya?
I guess I should've shed a tear for you
But I ain't really had the time for it
I used to have a good heart
Now tell me where the fuck he at
I might have lost it in your bed
Babe I know I was young
And maybe I was stupid
Is it 'cuz I hate love that I'd rather fuck them groupies?
I came off as strong but the inner me was dying
A
cting like nothing's wrong
Maybe I'm good at lying
Bang, bang, bang
She fucked it up
She stole my heart
But she rose my soul, my soul
She rose my soul, let me say
Hey
What you've done?
Look at me
Look at me now
I guess I should've been involved in it
I guess I should've bought you flowers, ain't it?
But ego's hell of a drug
I don't want to lose it up
So Imma love you like I love baby
I wish I was a better me for ya
But I don't really have the time for it
They'd rather build relationships
But they all look undecided
When they be talking about their own future
Yeah I know I'm still young
And I know I'm fucking stupid
To say I came off as strong
Damn I'm really good at lying
Bang, bang, bang
She fucked it up
She stole my heart
But she rose my soul, my soul
She rose my soul, let me say
Hey
What you've done?
Look at me
Look at me now
Maybe you tried
Not to love me
Only when you were drunk
Only when you were high
Bang, bang, bang
She fucked it up
She stole my heart
Tho she rose my soul, my soul
She rose my soul
Bang, bang, bang
She fucked it up
She stole my heart
But she rose my soul, my soul
She rose my soul, let me say
Hey
What you've done?
Look at me
Look at me now

Oh I swear on that day
Mama I felt your pain
Oh I swear, since that day
Imma fight until this bitch will finally get away
I know you got
Problems with liquor
Plus you're all alone, no money, with my sister
You were far from being a perfect mother
This hysteria didn't really help ya
You often offended me when I was a young boy
One day you even said you wished I was not born
I can't blame you, 'cause I love ya
Imma do my best not to see you suffer..
Again cuz this shit is stuck in my head
First time I ever saw Mama at work
I understood why she said "damn it's hell"
She's been cleaning shit for more than 10 years
I wouldn't even stand one fucking day
No she had no friends, no one to talk to
Yes a lotta racists look what she's been through
Being the only terrorist of the whole crew
"What the fuck is wrong with you?"
Something she never said
She shut her mouth for the mumu
Went back home, tired as fuck
Problems never left her shoes
Debts and bills, drugs & pills
Imma fuck this game for you
 x2
Oh I swear on that day
Mama I felt your pain
Oh I swear, since that day
Imma fight untill this bitch will finally get away
Away, away, away..
Away, away, away..
I don't want to see you working anymore
Once I'm blowing up, you will go fuck'em all
Holidays for life, let them sweep the floor
You deserve the best, but right now we stilll poor
One day Imma be able to pay your debts
From them raps & beats I'm making by myself
All these labels trynna be my friend
You told me to be boss and not to be a slave
So Imma raise the check
Raise the check
Up to the milli yeah
So Imma raise the check
Raise the check
Up to the milli yeah
 x2
Oh I swear on that day
Mama I felt your pain
Oh I swear, since that day
Imma fight untill this bitch will finally get away"I told you
I told you the struggle is only starting
Believe me"
Weed in my lungs
Weed on my mind
Why the fuck am I smoking like a Rastafarian ?
Buddin' the beat
Like weed in my brain
That why the tempo slowed down
But got my mind overspeeding
And you're deflecting
You got a thousand shit to do
But you're in her sheets
Your priorities fucked up
And lust is rising
You're waking up every morning
Bemoaning what you did
You reminisce the time you wasted
But cannot undo
You've been screaming "don't"
Little Devil whispered "I do"
Push me and my trust
Need to drink a tea with Badu
'Front of your body
Mine is struggling to handle
Way too much food for thoughts
And new philos
For things that fool on you and your focus
It is all around
Yet makes no noise
And got no shape
Goddamn
I can feel it
And I still bounce between feelings baby
Troublesome times
Not safe for work
Got me going crazy
All night long
And I still bounce between feelings baby
Troublesome times
Not safe for work
Got me going crazy
All night long
It has the finest ass
I won't talk about the face
If you look into its eyes
Lust will put you to your knees
It's starting with a sight
Then it's all over your psyche
Don't try to shout it out
Or you will turn into D.O.C
Noxious
Hades wants to bathe me in his fire
But Rilès got it all over his arms
So ladies don't tear my clock all appart
When this chronic got me wildin' on your body
Ouh
Well, I'm dancing with the Devil
In the stud
It's 'bout bad consequences
And I still bounce between feelings baby
Troublesome times
Not safe for work
Got me going crazy
All night long
And I still bounce between feelings baby
Troublesome times
Not safe for work
Got me going crazy
All night long
And tell me who's this guy from Porlock
He runnin around
My bedroom and my house
While I'm in a trance
For a song
He yellin' "Nigga down"
"i got bitches, bongs
Ballechin and fun
Booty, buns
Bigger than a Bible
Believe it or not"
I saw all the songs I want to sing
But the same day they forsake cuz I saw you
It is you ?
Or your friends ?
Or your family ?
Fans ?
Nah, yourself

Jump in that car and play my song
I work on every song as if it is the last one
Never slow down cuz every day feels like my last run
If you're wondering where's my boundaries I got none
You're wondering if I got Prozac? Yes I got some
But never used it
Nor abused it
I refused it
When my yema didn't
You won't use me with your bullshit
I told him
I'm getting aggressive when they do not deserve it
But oh
You got a place to cure the pain
You got your hands, you got your head
You got your heart, your brain
Your pen, your beats, your paint
Now use that shit
Amen!
Ho, will I see the sun? ohnono
Even when I'm dust? ohnono
Losing but not lost
P.S. Don't forget to grave on it what I say most
Enjoy the ride

Jump in that car and play my song
My song, my song..
S
alaam or Shalom to my brothers and sisters
United for the best
Innocent in your action
Cheap was more than enough
I know y'all pictured my vision when
Danger was all around
Excitation was with us
So let me break them doors
Bend them keys
Then look back
I say "that's my shit"
I'm hurting myself
So I'm tasting my sweat
I step back from my grief
And I can see what's next
Nah I might lose hope
I might lose peace
But when I'll look back
Imma praise that grit
So enjoy the ride and the view
Cuz I'm running out of
gas
I get it, I got it
I won't and cannot replace the time, no
Ho, will I see the sun? ohnono
Even when I'm dust? ohnono
Losing but not lost
P.S. Don't forget the black ice and the chrysanthemum
Enjoy the ride
It won't be long
Enjoy the ride
I know tomorrow I'll be gone
Enjoy the ride
It won't be long
Enjoy the ride

That's alright
You want me dead or me down
Don't like the way I'm expressing myself
I just want love for my craft
Me sacrificing everything for it
I don't know love, don't know life
Don't know vacations, don't know nothin' else
When you shit on my work
Maybe that hits me in a different way
Could you believe all they say?
Nah it's alright
Country's hating, all that hate
Nah it's alright
Medias still cut me off, still by myself? right
Imma promote the project, the only way, I-

I wish it could be just like the old days
The ones I used to love, I mean, the old days
When I was not the same back in the old days
When I thought I was sane, but it’s the old days
Lately I been thinking ‘bout them old days
When I didn’t lose myself but neither found it
The balance of ignorance for my young age
Yes I will do my best to feel these old days
Back before the racks
Before the swag
I wish I could feel like I’m fading the black
Wish I could feel like I’m still on the track
‘The fuck every morning just feels like a trap?
Back
Before the threats and the tats
Before the fame and the platinum plaques
Back
When hate was not in the ride
‘Fore they fantasized ‘bout me ending my life
I wish it could be just like the old days
The ones I used to love, I mean, the old days
When I was not the same back in the old days
When I thought I was sane, but it’s the old days
Why this, on my way no
Darkness, everywhere oh
Why me? Why myself? No
I won’t, fall in hell oh
It’s gon be ok, just like the old days
I will face my fears, just like the old days
I’ll take care of myself, just like the old days
I’ll thank God every day, just like the old days
I wish it could be just like the old days
The ones I used to love, I mean, the old days
When I was not the same back in the old days
When I thought I was sane but it’s the old daysBitches blacking out at my shows

Million plays with no videos
And it's, and it's just the beginning
Gon' tell my boss I quit that job
Beautiful women in my phone
Overseas fucking with my songs
And it's, and it's just the beginning
You lose or you learn, you face or you turn
Never had a middle man cuz I can't trust no one
5 years ago been to a studio to record a song
Quality was cheap as fuck tho he said he was a pro
Decided to build my own in my tiny bedroom
Fuck how long it will take me to raise the money, I knew
I had to be patient and work my ass off twice more than y'all
I read them books and watched them tutos aside of my 2 jobs
Sleepless nights to get this knowledge and look at me now
4 years later I'm back and feeling stronger than ever
Y'all said I'll never be able to make it all by myself
4 years later look at all these people screaming my name, yeah I got

Million plays with no videos
And it's, and it's just the beginning
Gon' tell my boss I quit that job
Beautiful women in my phone
Overseas fucking with my songs
And it's, and it's just the beginning
My story's History not run by your rules
The old white man cannot decide for youth
How many wish me to win but hope I lose
Lot of you owe me my time back shame on me for being good
Trying to box me, you say I cannot do it
They just want me to rap then fucking shut it
Music videos, yeah man, I all made them
African blood, we're used to work everything
Back and forth in Paris talking, talking business
Tattoos Rilèsundayz, shoutout to the real fans
Bringing all my niggas and we turn up on stage

Bitches blacking out at my shows

Gon' tell my boss I quit that job
Beautiful women in my phone
Overseas fucking with my songs
And it's, and it's just the beginning
It's just the beginning
I plan everything since 16

Always turning thoughts into things

I plan everything since 16

It's just the beginning
Always turning thoughts into things

My darling i want some bitches,fame and fortune
Went too far with all the bills, candles, oceans
I wish my parents were pillards and not jobless
I wish I would've been warned when I made mistakes
I wish I could really handle all the hate
All the lies, the plans ,the tricks, planned against my will
I say "ça a passé"
You threw your demon's at me
Why? Man brought me there
I'm alone in my bedroom finding myself screaming
Eeeeeeeyyyyyooooooooaaaaaaaaaeeeeooooooo
Eeeeeeeyyyyyooooooooaaaaaa..a..a..a
It's my style of tribulation
I used to run out of patience then diving in real depressions, planning a runaway
It's my style of tribulation
I used to run out of patience then she came in my direction blessings still follow me
My darling, I spent my savings making them clips
Spending days behind the screen but, shit it ain't tits
I'ma soon go back to broke broke, slide my richness
Aggravating mental health since I can't pay rents
Oooo
Sa7bi Look at you
Sa7bi Look at them
You got love tho you got pain
You got brothers tho you got hate
Sa7bi look at you
Sa7bi look at them

Out of sight niggas
Corazon que no siente
Say my shit was better before
But y'all were not there
Literally sold 5 copies of my mixtape
Back in the days I believed in Chano's independence
Huh
Livin' in the stud
Pass the bull
Morning afternoon
Enclosed in the cube
Work that groove
Always got the woo
Ideas step, I stew
All my beats
Got that genius brew
You better listen fool
I'm the one
Ain't no room for two
Oh lord
On my K-Dot shit
Shoutout for the flow
Bruh
Gotta kill my beat
Say, Oh lord
I'm mooving so quick
You got 1 song
You're on radio
You might have ate a dick
Yea my bad if my songs get a lil darker
Me don't go outside anymore
Days be shaping like a looper
I don't wake up, I can't sleep
Cook a meal and make a beat
Two more, then finally got ten
Cuz never satisfied with me
But i see myself improving
I learned some shit I couldn't see
Getting bette than EI-P
An closer to the D-R-E
Ricky Rubin, Timbo, 40
I'm coming for your asses quick
I can and I'll still be waiting
I ain't got time but I got will
Twenty One years old
I work like five men
Never ever losing my momentum
Don't speak english, yet they sing my anthems
Beats too good they don't believe I made them
Rappper, Producer, Engineer, Video Director, Painter
I don't give two fuck
If you think I say it too much
Oh lately they've been too many
To are about them toony niggas
Yeah too bad
Take a toothbrush
Cuz' your taste is doodoo
Now listen
He stated "sing for the hoes and rap for these niggas"
I'm Russ on steroids and Gogh on SSRIs
King Kunta with his feet
Swing, never switch my style
Life is short
Art is not
If i die my music won't
Hey
Thank God I can breath
I can be what they can't buy
Even when i'm weak
I'm sure I'm gon' fuck'em all
Thank God I can breath
I can be what they can't buy
Your buzz is too fake
Your career is just a Vine
OhHere goes another one who stood me up
Blood on my lips don't make it run onto your shirt
Here goes another one who stood me up
Blood on my lips don't make me do what I don't want
Damn, I see you're tryna fool me son
Is you niggas deaf or blind? I told you once
Making me repeat myself, so you waste my songs
Could've talked about my babe or about that cunt
Niggas be all afraid to talk to me dace to face
Fake your trace, pace me for weeks then fade
Your fable's fake and speech is vain
3andek, we know where's your basement bitch
Give me my money, money back, I'm on a rush man
Our bullets going straight, they never swoosh, man
Youngsters be listening my shit, fuck if I shook them
You made me quit the stud, so better run then
Give me my money, money back, I'm on a rush man
Our bullets going straight, they never swoosh, man
I was in Paris for my money and a freestyle
But I knew I was too high to be a Frenchman, hmhmm..
Here goes another one who stood me up
Blood on my lips don't make it run onto your shirt
Here goes another one who stood me up
Blood on my lips don't make me do what I don't want
Many men, wish death upon myself
Acting like they're not looking, but follow my steps
All you want is revenga since I left your business
It was the greatest decision I could've ever made
I'm hearing from others you do like to mention my name
Shit I've been wasting all this time cuz you stood in my way
Next time it's coming out your mouth my dick gon fill your chin
Don't make me pull the trigger on you, I know you got kids
Others be spitting their venim on some industry shit
"don't sign him", "don't talk about this kid"
"too optimistic", "dangerous for what we're in"
I'm crazy? Nahh.. just a little bit
Give me my money, money back, I'm on a rush man
Our bullets going straight, they never swoosh, man
Youngsters be listening my shit, fuck if I shook them
You made me quit the stud, so better run then
Give me my money, money back, I'm on a rush man
Our bullets going straight, they never swoosh, man
I was in Paris for my money and a freestyle
But I knew I was too high to be a Frenchman, hmhmm..

Give me my money, money back, I'm on a rush man
Our bullets going straight, they never swoosh, man
Youngsters be listening my shit, fuck if I shook them
You made me quit the stud, so better run thenI can go in
The jungle is a threat, you might lose yourself
Oh lemme go in
Was made for this tho sometimes i doubt it well
Business, feelings
Scratch n writings
Numbers, streaming
Buzz n fading
Cash is laking
Yet i can't quit
Demons yelling
Kush ain't healing
All this hate not really helping
I thought i was down but i'm deeper
Ah yema..
Watch out for the goons
Bro the fame is a bad man
If you quit they gon feast right
Everybody knew
But they shh
If you're too strong
Jealousy when the man climbs
And the girls turn into snake now hmm
ATM be my name now hm?
I swear I got the feeling that my feelings dead
Oh baba, yema
Everyone changed
Is you still the same with me  ?
Not feeling sane
Oh baba yema
Everyone changed
Or am i just breaking down down down
I might not make it, lord lost me there
Angels 'bove my head already gone
Pray for me as i am just a man
Terrified by demons chasing him
Ahhhhh
Since the beginning ain't took a rest
Working till death
Juggling between business n friends
Bros n expenses
"sorry but they want to put you side"
PR stress' high
Country on their feelings once I signed
Get your mind right
Still a four feet bed
In a two-piece cage
Driving 5-speed wreck
Bumping Pac n Jay
With no AC in
10 on five seat fam
Wtf you mean, i never changed for millions
I'm stathamin stani's freestyle
It's all love or it's all last rites
Better watch and get your mind right
Who?
It's in french so don't care 'bout your feedback
24months in my stud/cave
Nobody guided me through it
So much tracks, I'm feeling Prince
Do I really need to quit ?
They'll be happy if I end up  dead
Oh baba, yema
Everyone changed
Is you still the same with me  ?
Not feeling sane
Oh baba yema
Everyone changed
Or am i just breaking down down downI think I need a girl who does meditation
'fore I go numb and fall apart
I need to go for resolutions
If I want to make it till tomorrow
Them drugs inefficient
I feel insignificant like juju and curses
Took the time to make a remake of my sins, choices, mistakes
Eyy
I know I'm gonna do it
Do it again
And even more
Chik chak
I face myself
Troubling both my wit, my sense
Buckle up
My 3ein, my din
Hopefully get down with finesse
Business
Distress
Rilès you forget yo self
I still didn't switch
Witness
My fall and then me ascent
And if you're there
Hesitation
Would it be just an illusion
Well if I sense
Your vibration
I won't ever be on my own
I think I need a girl who does meditation
'fore I go numb n fall apart
I need to go for resolutions
If I want to make it till tomorrow
I know sometimes its painful
But I choose to keep it on the low
I did plan to tell a story
All these years trapped with my choice
Do it
Do not
Doubts and grow
Careful
Juju
Domino
I guess I cannot backpedal
It's too late now
Hmm
I think I need a girl who does meditation
'fore I go numb n fall apart
I need to go for resolutions
If I want to make it till tomorrowEverybody wants to bite a piece of the cake
No, you won't go 'fore you got your name
Carevd in minds of who you really praise
Everybody wants to take your seat, forsake
You shall not go after you made it, man
Not enough to get the man a name
From the bottom of the jungle
To the perfume of a blunt
Gotta quit the Remington
Frome the beauty of the sun
To the booty of my girl
I won't leave you 'till I'm done
I know I gave it lot of praises
But damnation feels like it's fading away
I know I gave y'all lotta hard times
Though t my mission would end after 52 songs
Shut down the suicide doors
This is my life, homie
You decide yours
Y'all know that Ye was my force
This ain't my time
I still gotta eat more
Y'all know that he talked to me
"Find a way to tell 'em
Then you'ill go back to me"
Wut ?
This is how it was supposed to be
I don't want that shit anymore
Sorry Lord I'm more than just a puzzle
I know I'm running the risk
Won't ever know what's rest
Oh no no
I know I'm running the risk
Don't you want me to dare ?
Tell my family it's just the dawn
Tell my homies I'm on my way
Tell my baby don't say "first round"
Cuz I ain't even started yet
Tell my family it's just the dawn
Tell my homies I'm on my way
Tell my baby don't say "first round"
Cuz I ain't even started yet
Crooked minds
Shady Ideas
Relentless will
Are perfect pieces
For the bam bam
Times saved me many times
I always knew that patience
Would've been one of my best friend
You bungee jump
Me, marathon in this game
Better keep my pace on track
I run run
This empire's too young
If you leave it
I swear the foundations
Gon swifftly fall down
I know I'm running the risk
Won't ever know what's rest
Oh no no
I know I'm running the risk
Don't you want me to dare ?
Tell my family it's just the dawn
Tell my homies I'm on my way
Tell my baby don't say "first round"
Cuz I ain't even started yet
Tell my family it's just the dawn
Tell my homies I'm on my way
Tell my baby don't say "first round"
Cuz I ain't even started yet
Let's
Beat the frame arround the fakers
Not in your TV
But will appear in your cabesas
Let's
Be the ones you'll always always notice
Leave a chance on the ground
And Imma be there to take it
Let's
Gain back the 20 lbs I lost
And gave my face it's true color
I'm sick of that dull
Let's
Stay here 'till forever
Until he takes me
Back to heaven
Tell my family it's just the dawn
Tell my homies I'm on my way
Tell my baby don't say "first round"
Cuz I ain't even started yet
Tell my family it's just the dawn
Tell my homies I'm on my way
Tell my baby don't say "first round"
Cuz I ain't even started yetAyayayayaya

Ayayayayaya
Ayayayayaya
Ayayayayaya
Ayaya-
Rilès better run, as always
If it's a burden, let it burn then
What a beautiful mess
Under my palms
"Welcome to the jungle" as you said
What if I sat in from the first day
What if I was the trap I didn't know
To my family
To my friends
To my mistakes
Through my fear
Please don't save me once again
To my feelings
To my sense
To my weaknesses, I beg
To leave me 'lone
When I'm insane
Ayayayayaya
Ayayayayaya
Ayayayayaya
Ayayayayaya
Ayayayayaya
Ayayayayaya
Ayayayayaya
Ayayayayaya
Bye my bonds
Bye my friends
Bye my money
Bye my house
Bye that fame
Bye them parties
Bye my wife if I got one
Shit I don’t care
I loved you
I just lied for them verses
Everybody got chains but we don't see
I'm working on my psyche for the lead
Realest for me those who don't give a shit
And for the art I could leave on my knees
I'll never die, I'm still working on it
Seems like nobody got balls to get free
You'll see the light
Before that click
Run for your life
Stop when you feel
To my family
To my friends
To my mistakes
Through my fear
Please don't save me once again
To my feelings
To my sense
To my weaknesses, I beg
To leave me 'lone
When I'm insane
Ayayayayaya
Ayayayayaya
Ayayayayaya
Ayayayayaya
Ayayayayaya
Ayayayayaya
Ayayayayaya
Ayayayayaya
Hahahahahaha
So far it has been a long and winding road
But you're still miles and miles away from your final destination
If you're doing well, your psyche will not take over your sanity
And now
Aware that you entered the Jungle
The one and only purpose of your existence
Is to survive in it
HahahahaYeah, yeah, yeah
I think I'm outside
It's just been a while though, let's go
(
Twenty9

I got feelings, I got needs
But the jungle's in my way 
I'm still healing, but not weak
If I'm in, I gotta stay

I got up, I got up, I got up 
Then I felt as if I, never would 
I got up, once again I got up
I got up, I got weak, then I walked
Aye, penetenciary flow like Abdul
If you wanna be damned, fuck it, that's on you
What you really mean? Darkness, was awful then
But shit got an end
Look how son, this shit did become 
Please don't  'til we're done 
Truth be told, it's real dumb 
If you don't like it don't listen 
I got up, I got up, I got up
I got up, 'cause I got them

Who ?
Qui
? Give me the name
City, a place, and a phone 
I'ma shake you, your mom, your kids and gang 
Or your polo punk ass friends 
While I'm in your keys and keen
She picks the paint, I change the wheels
Never think 'bout slowin' it down 
Better keep a lil' doubt
Big protein, got to be like Mamba
Rocky or Mufasa
Oh God, oh why, your talk's full of testament?
It's the past, I mean 2010 
Heartless since the beginning
I did flip the script and I'm rich
I got feelings, I got needs

Himalaya, dangerous as fire
Himalaya, Gods worship her
Himalaya, she ran over
Himalaya, smooth as my pain
Himalaya, scorches the rain
Himalaya, graciously you maim
Himalaya, pussy from Wayne
Himalaya, abstract as your dogma
Himalaya, shooting down the tiger
Himalaya, love is just a drama
Himalaya, love is just a trauma
I which I didn't look at you
You, Medusa
I which I didn't look at you
Poisonous Shiva
Himalaya, abstract as your dogma
Himalaya, shooting down the tiger
Himalaya, love is just a drama
Himalaya, love is just a trauma
Eyes made of diamonds
Mouth californium
Cheeks taaffeite
But you face is just painite
All these sparks I've ever seen, you're the one
I can't incur
All these charms hailing from your body, so rare
But I can't bear
Himalaya, abstract as your dogma
Himalaya, shooting down the tiger
Himalaya, love is just a drama
Himalaya, love is just a trauma
Fascinating chimera, don't know where are you from
Vagina dentata, tempting venom
Big is my desire, to embrace your edges
To caress the danger, demise is your pledge, noYou sat on my mind
For a great amount of time
You ran on my soul
For the longest I didn't know
I've been planting seeds in my head
Before the shine and all
Though I really tried to forget
I can't escape the call
You sat on my mind
For a great amount of time
You ran on my soul
For the longest I didn't know
It's my fate
It's my chance
It's my paint
I cannot backpedal
It was written
Not up there
But by my hands
Thank you for the love
Thank you for the love
Now I gotta go
I love you so
Sorry, I'm so sorry
Sorry, I'm so sorryStop wondering and just go
Smoke but will not stoned
Bitch believing in my soul
If she wasn't there I would've probably been gone
I been drowning
Cuban dolls, sins
I been going down
I been runnin-
Side my mind and
I found nothing bright
I feel better when I'm home
It feels like I wanna live forever
Threw my balance in the jungle
Pray for me if I ain't getting better
So keep on, keep on running
Keep on running 'gainst the choppa choppa
Keep on, keep on running
Keep on running till you finally find it
Your trick's feeling like a déjà vu
 was nobody's friend until I blew
Fake promises, bless me with the truth
Industry repeats its bullshit too
I need lotta space
Block your textos
Sorry miss
Don't want your fat ass
In my bedroom
Wait downstairs, oh
Back at it again
Going through my head
Nah, it won't leave
‘less I take a pill
Or I hit the gym
I been drowning
Cuban dolls, sins
I been going down
I been running
Side my mind and
I found nothing bright
I feel better when I'm home
It feels like I wanna live forever
Threw my balance in the jungle
Pray for me if I ain't getting better
So keep on, keep on running
Keep on running 'gainst the choppa choppa
Keep on, keep on running
Keep on running till you finally find it
Trip away
Fix your face
Looking drained
Every night
I been playing the evils
Faking it
Happiness
Where you at?
Surely not
In the moist of her clito where..
I been drowning
Cuban dolls, sins
I been going down
I been running
Side my mind and
I found nothing bright
I feel better when I'm home
It feels like I wanna live forever
Threw my balance in the jungle
Pray for me if I ain't getting better
So keep on, keep on running
Keep on running 'gainst the choppa choppa
Keep on, keep on running
Keep on running till you find it x2
After the darkness will come the sun
That shit I said was just a mistake
What if I burn my wings on the road?
What if I shut down lights by myself?
I ain't got time for your pussies
Time for them hoes
Even if I love the way you dance
I keep my circle close
Ain't no time for the critics
Tired of it all
Went from most loved to most hated without moving out of home
But fuck, I'm moving overseas
2018, NYC
They've been making fun of me
While I got meetings with JB
Getting out of my country
They were not ready for my shit
You want facts you gon' get them
So I'll be back with a Grammy
 x2
After the darkness will come the sun
That shit I said was just a mistake
What if I burn my wings on the road?
What if I shut down lights by myself?
P
aris with my
brother So'
And we're meeting CEOs
Rilès international
Labels be blowing up my phone
Empire's starting to grow
Females come but never go
Reading contracts all night long
A hundred times just to make sure
Nobody's fooling the plan, imma write it my way
California this summer,
nah I don't pay the tickets
Alright, alright, it's all good, don't talk 'bout what's secret
Imma finish Rilèsundayz
then you gon see it
Silence and I were friends
Fireworks made us lose the bond
Darling I figured out
Peace wasn't made for me at all..
 x2
After the darkness will come the sun
That shit I said was just a mistake
What if I burn my wings on the road?
What if I shut down lights by myself?
What if I burn my wings
If I keep going
Cuz I couldn't stop
When I had the chance
What if I do it right
And I shut it down
Ain't that enough to remain in minds?
What if I burn my wings
If I keep going
Cuz I couldn't stop
When I had the chance
What if I do it right
And I shut it down
Is that enough to remain in minds? x2
Unexpected turn
That was an unexpected turn
I should’ve seen it coming
But I am not done
No I’m not
I should’ve seen it coming
But I am not done
No I’m not
Lately I’ve been in a rollercoaster mind
And my body cannot follow what’s inside
Will I still love me if I retire?
No, I’m not afraid to take the shot
No, I’m not afraid to say goodbye
Unexpected turn
That was an unexpected turn
I should’ve seen it coming
But I am not done
No I’m not
I should’ve seen it coming
But I am not done
No I’m not
And I’ve been thinking ‘bout it almost every night
I might sound so crazy ‘front of y’all
I’m looking for answers, I see none
So I guess it was written in Time
Next time’s probably gonna be the last
 x2
Unexpected turn
That was an unexpected turn
I should’ve seen it coming
But I am not done
No I’m not
I should’ve seen it coming
But I am not done
No I’m notRun motherfucker, run
Don't you slow down
No time for the past
When the present is doubt
Lotta shit to prove and looking behind is the trap
Oh the sand I see right now is only in my hourglass
Run motherfucker, run
Never slow down
No time for the past
When the present is doubt
Gotta lotta shit to do and looking behind is the trap
I was escaping the desert but they've been following my path
Oh
You won't bite me, nah
You can't bite me, nah
Got the
pungi
in my bag
Don't make me play for ya
Reality's not
Talking to you, why?
Maybe I'm stuck in the desert
Caught up in a mirage
Off of me
Off of me
Fuego at the tip of my fingers
Off of me
Off of me
Lately apples been looking handsome
Ohh ready for them rounds
Watch out on the ground
"Oh Lord.."
..he helped me too much
So I won't bother him
No more
Ready for them rounds
Watch out on the ground
Oh Lord
You helped me too much
Now I got snakes jumping on me
Save me now..
Solo but a lot
Embrace my skin, you won't bite my eyes
Next step is the dogs
Damn I brace myself against the wild
Nerves remain in place
Underneath my dirty mule head
Damages on my face
El hamdoulilah my mind:
Safe
Off of me
Off of me
Fuego at the tip of my fingers
Off of me
Off of me
Apples never appeared that handsome
Ohh ready for them rounds
Watch out on the ground
"Oh Lord.."
..he helped me too much
So I won't bother him
No more
Ready for them rounds
Watch out on the ground
Oh Lord
You helped me too much
Now I got snakes jumping on me
Save me now..He don't give a fuck
He don't give a damn

How many nights and evenings you spent smoking and drinking?
Oh, looking dumb right now
Take a sip or take a drag
Oh no stress now, hun
Azaza in every party
Every night another story
That nigga's a laboratory, but
A bit afraid for ya
I wish what happened to me never falls on ya, nah
Remember when I stressed out
I asked you how you don't mind about anything
You simply told me to
"Fucklalife my nigga"
What you mean?
"Fucklalife my nigga"

Oh, looking rash right now
Many sips and many drags he wasted now, hun
Azaza in every party
Every night another story

None of my worries solved shit, it just widened the scars

He told me to "fucklalife my nigga"
Since that day I fucklalife my nigga

That shit I said was just a mistake
What if I burn my wings on the road ?
What if I shut down lights by myself ?
After the darkness will come the sun
That shit I said was just a mistake
What if I burn my wings on the road ?
What if I shut down lights by myself ?
I ain't got time for your pussies
Time for them hoes
Even if I love the way you dance
I keep my circle close
Ain't no time for the critics
Tired of it all
Went from most loved to most hated
Without moving out of home
But fuck, I'm moving overseas
2018, NYC
They've been making fun of me
While I got meetings with JB
Getting out of my country
They were not ready for my shit
You want facts ?
You gon' get them
So I'll be back with a Grammy
After the darkness will come the sun
That shit I said was just a mistake
What if I burn my wings on the road ?
What if I shut down lights by myself ?
After the darkness will come the sun
That shit I said was just a mistake
What if I burn my wings on the road ?
What if I shut down lights by myself ?
Paris with my brother So'
And we're meeting CEOs
Rilès international
Labels be blowing up my phone
Empire's starting to grow
Females come but never go
Reading contracts all night long
A hundred times just to make sure
Nobody's fooling the plan, imma write it my way
California this summer, nah I don't pay the tickets
Alright, alright, it's all good, don't talk 'bout what's secret
Imma finish Rilèsundayz then you gon see it
Silence and I were friend
Fireworks made us lose the bond
Darling I figured out
Peace wasn't made for me at all
Silence and I were friend
Fireworks made us lose the bond
Darling I figured out
Peace wasn't made for me at all
After the darkness will come the sun
That shit I said was just a mistake
What if I burn my wings on the road ?
What if I shut down lights by myself ?
After the darkness will come the sun
That shit I said was just a mistake
What if I burn my wings on the road ?
What if I shut down lights by myself ?
What if I burn my wings
If I keep going
Cuz I couldn't stop
When I had the chance
What if I do it right
And I shut it down
Ain't that enough to remain in minds ?
What if I burn my wings
If I keep going
Cuz I couldn't stop
When I had the chance
What if I do it right
And I shut it down
Ain't that enough to remain in minds ?Hey,Hey,Hey,Hey

I'M TOO BUSY GOT NO TIME
TO CARE ABOUT WHAT THE FUCK IS SO WRONG WITH
NIGGAS FIGHTING FOR THE CROWN
WHILE I BE LOOKIN' AT THEM FROM THE THRONE
Sak pasé? Sak pasé?
Lately my life's been a challenge
So pardon my French if I don't give a fuck 'bout your feelings
I told you last week what you hear, I did it all alone
Let me tell next week I'll release a hella video
I'm still editing the footage I can't trust no one
I tried to let them niggas do it, that shit was not fine
So listen bro when I tell you I'm running out of time
Look at me my nigga I can't even finish my lin..
I'M TOO BUSY GOT NO TIME
TO CARE ABOUT WHAT THE FUCK IS SO WRONG WITH
NIGGAS FIGHTING FOR THE CROWN
WHILE I BE LOOKIN' AT THEM FROM THE THRONE
Hold on, Hold on
Many talk but who got their shit done?
Got a mom and a sis' to  watch over
Plus I got a job
Habibi, habibi
I don't let love in the plan
I made a lotta mistakes before
Me try not do them again
Rilèsundayz 'bout to blow up yeah they feel the storm
Solo, solo working it, solo getting coins
Droppin' a deuce on the game as they sleep on my songs
Zerma
you said you don't know me but I'm all on your phone
I'M TOO BUSY GOT NO TIME
TO CARE ABOUT WHAT THE FUCK IS SO WRONG WITH
NIGGAS FIGHTING FOR THE CROWN
WHILE I BE LOOKIN' AT THEM FROM THE THRONEI did it for the challenge, always close to tumblin’
I can’t believe I’m almost done man what a battle and
The worst is yet to come as I did deviated plans
He’s knocking in the studio since #46 I’m late
It’s bigger than the music, weirder than the Piri Reis
It’s been 268 weeks I’m obsessed with it
So let’s say whatever the fuck will happen, will happen
Amiran for the trick, and damn I’m really feeling no regrets
OK, get this done
Look up
Don’t look back, and run
He’s gon hurt you for your guts
Fight it like a champion
OK, get this done
Look up
Don’t look back, and run
He’s gon kill you for your guts
Fight it like a champion
And I jumped off the cliff, landed in Maïa’s hands
If I had to start all over, I would do it again
Cuz I, live with no regrets, no doubt, no I wish I did
When Rilèsundayz is done, it’s gon be the beginning
Try to test me
Thrill me
Not a lot impress me
Love me
Hate me
‘Least you won’t forget me
Curse me
Bless me
I’m already blasted
It took me lot of years of training
And I will no waste them
Westside, Indies
All my people listening
Mix it
Bounce it
Talk with the quality
Drugs & dark rings
I’m awake since last week
Cautions, warnings
Should I pay attention
OK, get this done
Look up
Don’t look back, and run
He’s gon hurt you for your guts
Fight it like a champion
OK, get this done
Look up
Don’t look back, and run
He’s gon kill you for your guts
Fight it like a champion
Stunting on your traps, gave a lotta indications
Somedays I which I could tape yo lips so watch & remain silent
It’s gon be the end on time, if time’s allowing me to finish
Wanna guess the words I’ll say
But you won’t find the tale into ‘em
You won’t give in to
Numerous favors
I know it’s hard to
Live like a hermit
All those sacrifices
It was worth it
Last but not least
So end it with style and
OK, get this done
Look up
Don’t look back, and run
He’s gon hurt you for your guts
Fight it like a champion
OK, get this done
Look up
Don’t look back, and run
He’s gon kill you for your guts
Fight it like a championHahahahaHistory repeats itself
With the blood and with the hate
I don’t like to see that face
When you say once again
“Que será, será
 Noche pasará
Sin importar que llores o te rías
Que será, será
 Noche pasará
Sin importar que te mueras o vivas “
Oh
You lose faith and faith is losing you
Your love faints under hate’s uppercut
You keep on singing the same old song
Once again you’re throwing bits of hope
History repeats itself
With the blood and with the hate
I don’t like to see that face
When you say once again
“I finessed the proof
And it’s the truth
Your try for peace is just a vain
Attempt to dilute the hate, the rage, the pain, the pill
The people track & try to cheat
Cuz I traveled all around the fear
Defended flaws and feels
Followed the foolish way
Now freedom’s so dumb
I don’t believe in nothing but the bitter taste of yesterday
Yeah the hopeless song
Is swiping strong
Cuz nothing changed
And nothing won’t
We think we care
Indeed we don’t
We gon’ forget and swap the same mistake
‘em dollars, add them genres
Races, religions
Perks and burdens
Pride to worsen
Worships, words to dust
And there’s the world I’m watchin "
“Que será, será
 Noche pasará
Sin importar que llores o te rías
Que será, será
 Noche pasará
Sin importar que te mueras o vivas “
Oh
You lose faith and faith is losing you
Your love faints under hate’s uppercut
You keep on singing the same old song
Once again you’re throwing bits of hope
Tell me, oh tell me
Why’re you not leaving this world?
If it is so fuckin bad
Let me handle you the gun
And
Now you’re looking down
Triggers shutting many mouths
Focused on the bad
When shit goes down you switch your mind up
Your philosophy is oh so fake
Innocent and guilty ‘front my face
Fatalistic, son you fake a self
Tearing feelings down so you’re feeling high
Colorblind like Logan It’s ok
Golden tissue to cry it’s ok
And you talk the most
Just to say the less
Next time keep that grief
To your fucking self
“Que será, será
 Noche pasará
Sin importar que llores o te rías
Que será, será
 Noche pasará
Sin importar que te mueras o vivas “
Oh
You lose faith and faith is losing you
Your love faints under hate’s uppercut
You keep on singing the same old song
Once again you’re throwing bits of hope
I told you “let us dare”, no matter what
Fugit tempus
This ain’t no fantasy, nah it’s my life
Hallelujahs
You know the hair, the fire, the boy, the style
Djazaïrias
I’d be a millionaire if my account
Was in Dinars
And you see, they all shake
When a jigga like me breaks
The industry suddenly st-t-tutter
Back to back to LA
Heading to the VMAs
Imma see those imma m-m-murder
But ain’t no pimpin’
Money savin’
Jigga said I gotta save it and invest it latter
Ain’t no great win
Without great pain
That’s why I’m pushing my body to the limits, furtherI see they don't want us here
I know they're feeling the thrill
She wanted me to come by
But didn't know Rilès moves with the crib
Calling me for your party
Only when I be buzzin'
I do appreciate the love
So I'm bringing all my niggas with me
Now I got a little bit of fame
I little bit of money
And a little bit more heys
A little bit more fake friends
Who want to bite the plan
Tho I got my bulletproof vest
We made over the years
You see me like a freak
Let me show you how I feast
Waseem got his pad on
So fuck your radio playlist
You wanted to use me
Show your friends that we were friends
Now we're in your momma's house
T'd up like we always did
So you said "it's been a while"
You only miss me when I'm gone
Rolling up, pouring up
Screaming "fuck'em all" loud
No we've never changed
Ohh
You don't really want us all around
I thought you knew me so wassup now
I love it when you want us to stop
I love it when you see what we're on
You don't really want us all around
I thought you knew me,
what you gon' do now ?
I love it when you want us to stop
I love it when you see what we're on
I know we're looking dumb
You want us out
If it ain't yours babe
It's another one
I love the way we're not caring 'bout nothin'
It's only for those nights I don't want to leave y'all
Han
Savage on savage on savage
Pass me the weed I won't pass you my problems
Last night I ran too much
Y'all see me stressin'
You came on time
I did not hit the bangbang
Always too much
Hopefully never enough
Come with the gang
You gon' forget your girl
I'm not the Rilès you saw or you heard
I'm Rilès 'You should've known me better"
From the backseat
We spent all those nights
Freestyling 'bout shit
You've been dancing, dancing, dancing over now
So you said "it's been a while"
You only miss me when I'm gone
Rolling up, pouring up
Screaming "fuck'em all" loud
No we've never changed
Ohh
You don't really want us all around
I thought you knew me so wassup now
I love it when you want us to stop
I love it when you see what we're on
You don't really want us all around
I thought you knew me, what you gon' do now ?
I love it when you want us to stop
I love it when you see what we're on
You'll never replace the time
You better let us dare
I'm on a mission, you're not
You better let us dare
You'll never replace the time
You better let us dare
I'm on a mission, you're not
You better let us dare
Ohh
You don't really want us all around
I thought you knew me so wassup now
I love it when you want us to.. Shut the fuck up
I love it when you see what we're on
You don't really want us all around
I thought you knew me, what you gon' do now ?
I love it when you want us to stop
I love it when you see what we're on
Rilèsundayz every sunday
Rilèsundayz every sunday
Rilèsundayz every sunday
I'm killing the game every sunday
In my bedroom every sunday
Mix, mastered, engineered only by me
In my bedroom every sunday
And y'all niggas act like you still don't see meBack from the underground
Chasing me up
Stumble and stop
Still in the Jungle
And cheetahs still been starving for months
See the snakes on the wheel
Evil eye over me
Everybody lookin' at you
He not happy 'bout it
Better run for your life
I'd rather enjoy the ride
Shit is getting really real
But I got no User guide
U-turns all on my side
Suckers all on my sight
Game is finally starting
Rilès, show what you got
You'll never catch me up
Fire blazing on the highway
I saw down to hell
I'm the most wanted man
You'll never catch me up
Fire blazing on the highway
I saw down to hell
I'm the most wanted man
Free the pressure
Keep on playing
Me never tired
I was alone for too long
See me now, It's too late I'm mad
I might do shit Imma regret
Since I've been fucking la life
But I never was and still not afraid of Luci..
"Shh, don't say his name"
Run motherfucker run
You play too much you think you can fool me more than once
See my face on your mirror
Handek
Enjoy your last ride
I got some sand in my pocket for ya
Three, two, one, motherfucker gon' die
Adios Rilès, It's a matter of time
Now
You'll never catch me up
Fire blazing on the highway
I saw down to hell
I'm the most wanted man
You'll never catch me up
Fire blazing on the highway
I saw down to hell
I'm the most wanted man
Free the pressure
Keep on playing
Me never tired
I was alone for too long
See me now, It's too late I'm mad
I might do shit Imma regret
Since I've been fucking la life
But I never was..
"WAKE UP ! WAKE UP ! WAKE UP!!"
 x2
The Devil missed his prey
I'm still the most wanted
The Devil missed his prey
One more time I ran away
912 ambulance, 21 years old man
Severaly injured on the head after a car accident
Unconscious, on the A13, it's 11:30
121135
Damn
I was supposed to be dead
Close to Dean
You put me back right in
I know we both made a deal
You grant me life
For a short period
I ain't got much months left
The puzzle started since '14
And soon it will end
Songs been feeling what's next
I'm afraid of what I think
I wasn't ready for it
Time is still the enemy
The Devil missed his prey
I'm still the most wanted
The Devil missed his prey
One more time I ran away
The Devil missed his prey
I'm still the most wanted
The Devil missed his prey
Mima watched over meWell..
Even in that deep misery
I felt my energy revive
And I said to myself
In spite of everything
I shall rise again
I will take up my pencil
Which I have forsaken in great discouragement
And I will go on with my writing
From that moment
Everything has seemed transformed to me
Fuck all your noise
Fuck all your noise
Imma scream louder than all of them boys
Can you believe it?
Of course you didn’t
Imma take vacations only when I’ll be gone
That is my choice
I love my choices
I’m hella sick but I still got my voice
Cruel summer in the vision
So I’m making songs trying to bring back the shade of my force
Fuck all your coins
Talk all you want
If you got no strategy
We gon’ move on
Give me strength for the next months of my life
I got too many ideas
Not enough time
Not enough space but inside of my mind
‘Bout to hire my b for the customer line
I made 10K this week
I gave my momma 9
But the money won’t ever stop me from the grind
I feel it coming I won’t get no grace
I feel it coming I won’t ask for help
This summer’s already has a taste from Hell
Will I ever be the same
Oh baba, gotta be a man
Fuck all your friends
Fuck all of them
Don’t induce me in the trap for the fame
I’m lacking energy
You see my face
Don’t invite no more
I don’t pop the champagne
Fuck all your clubs
And the doormen
I don’t do showcases
If you do, you’re lame
Oh you’re doing it ‘cause you had an advance
From a shitty label, now you need to repay
I’m talking to myself
That the only advice
I keep on losing weight
But it is worth the price
As long as you got hands, motherfucker you’ll write
I admit, I might have done too much sacrifices
But now they’re fucking with the name
Not everybody will like you anyway
Nah
Lot of bodies in my case
Got them in my pockets
Haters advertising me
I feel it coming I won’t get no grace
I feel it coming I won’t ask for help
This summer’s already has a taste from Hell
Will I ever be the same
Oh mama, gotta be a man
 *2
Now you can raise your hands
Give me powers for the run
Closer to the end
Will I touch the finish line?
Will you see what was hidden at the bottom of my mind..Oh my darling don’t you cry
The show must go on
Oh my darling don’t you cry
I’m feeling fine
Running away from the rift
Didn’t follow the way I was supposed
Now I uncover my wounds
And y’all aware of what you mustn’t know
Everybody knows the name
But you don’t know what’s inside of myself
I can’t wait for you to figure out half of that shit
And I’m ready to walk alone
Even on the darkest nights
Oh you left on the way?
Homie you been listening for your eyes
And I’m ready to walk alone
Even on the darkest nights
“Passar bem, passar mal
Tudo neste mundo é um passar”
Oh my darling don’t you cry
The show must go on
Oh my darling don’t you cry
I’m feeling fine
“Hold on, hold on, hold on
I told you you were crazy
You better stop, you better stop..!
Oh.. oh you want death?
That’s what you want?.. “
Let us dare
Let us dare to do great things
My potential and my will always in sync
I ain’t getting really tired but just insane
Ain’t that what you wanted for this ‘17
I still got 50 beats down to get killed
And another hundred more that I won’t sell
But I produce everyday that’s in my genes
Pressure on my path I gotta meditate with Rubin
I’m sorry if I hurt you
Last week another fight
Anew Me vs. Me
But I was about to drown
I'mma stop fucking complaining
And focus on my craft
And smash that finish line
And then fuck up all your minds
And I’m ready to walk alone
Even on the darkest nights
Oh you left on the way?
Homie you been listening for your eyes
And I’m ready to walk alone
Even on the darkest nights
“Passar bem, passar mal
Tudo neste mundo é um passar”
Oh my darling don’t you cry
The show must go on
Oh my darling don’t you cry
I’m feeling fine
Oh you wanna stay, uh?
You're still inspired?
You're always inspired
Ok, ok..
I'mma make sure your 5 last week gon' be your toughest
Let's see if you can make itCome closer listen to me
Now that we're in the same area
For this time I leave you safe
I won't bear another last word
Sex so easy to sell, go get these bitches
Knowledge has become so small, two, three inches
Listening with their eyes, but they're blind
And I fuck these zombies, and I fuck their mind
They are spitting their vomit, right on her sweet face
Eyes drooling when they see it; Money, Money's race
Art is not even existing, creed is commonplace
You're the king of nothing, shining in blindness
Never, never get my respect, murdering all these brains
Killer, killer of intellect,
starving for your gains
Talking shit is your business,
you should burn in flames
But you ain't a bastard enough
And you would still be the same bitch
Same bitch, same goals, same balls
Same beats, same clips, simple
Same shit, same shame, same prose
Deus of error,
begging for another clause
Same bitch, same goals, same balls
Same beats, same clips, simple
Enough I hate you, in fact I hate you all
I wanna crush you, I wanna beat you
Period 
Boredom
No meaning
These pigs are here for one thing
Speaking
Unfamous
Your death has never been so obvious
Folks trying to beat me
Ain't got no family
Why don't you see what I see ?
Oh, your eyes can't handle it ?
Oh, of course no, this ain't legit
All of you now so implicit
This was not made for
brainlesses
Light-minded's fault
Bitches from Dionysus
I had to do something
I am not sorry
The force is stronger than me
This ain't a misbehaving
My bitch is so stunning
Yours is not existing
Your fake muse was the last one
I told you, here's your last words
BitchBitch get outta my way
I can do it again
Fire punching  your flows
Catch them hoes
Never catching Ls
Charizard
in my team
Bulbausaur
for your band
Rilès killing them
leagues
So he went over the rap game
Tell me tell me
Where's my rivals ?
I'm still searching  y'all
I'm
lvl. 100
stuck in
P-Town
You can't catch me
Catch me, catch me, catch me
All day cooking in the lab
with
Oak
Now you know, now you know
Bitch get outta my way
I believe in myself
You can pay all you want
Bitch you'll never have my secret
Master ball
on your girl
Master ball
on your fans
If you don't understand shit
Where the fuck were you in 2k ?
Beby
Gotta catch'em all
I'm talking trophies
Multitasking
Greater than your
Eevee
Never outside like a legendary
Like a legendary, like a legendary
Bitch get outta my way
Fire all on my limbs
Shit
I remember
With my brother
24/7 on it
We caught them bitches
Demolished
Blue
Reminiscing time
When my only concern
Was to find that goddamn
Mewtwo
Now I got to pay them fuckin bills
And momma's getting hella sick
Plus I got issues with my chick
But shit that's how it fucking is
Time's illusion moving slow
But hits you really really quick
When I heard them melodies
I knew my childhood's gone forever
When I heard them melodies
My psyche felt a lil better
Ouhhh
Damn I miss that time
But I still got my
Game boy
with me tho
Boy, what ?
Shit.. Ain't no battery in it, fuck
Bitch get outta my way
I can do it again
Fire punching  your flows
Catch them hoes
Never catching Ls
Charizard in my team
Bulbausaur
for your band
Rilès killing them leagues
So he went over the rap game
Tell me tell me
Where's my rivals ?
I'm still searching  y'all
I'm lvl. 100 stuck in P-Town
You can't catch me
Catch me, catch me, catch me
All day cooking in the lab with

Now you know, now you knowAfter the darkness will come the sun
That shit I said was just a mistake
What if I burn my wings on the road?
What if I shut down lights by myself?
After the darkness will come the sun
That shit I said was just a mistake
What if I burn my wings on the road?
What if I shut down lights by myself?
I ain't got time for your pussies
Time for them hoes
Even if I love the way you dance
I keep my circle close
Ain't no time for the critics
Tired of it all
Went from most loved to most hated without moving out of home
But fuck, I'm moving overseas
2018, NYC
They've been making fun of me
While I got meetings with JB
Getting out of my country
They were not ready for my shit
You want facts you gon' get them
So I'll be back with a Grammy
After the darkness will come the sun
That shit I said was just a mistake
What if I burn my wings on the road?
What if I shut down lights by myself?
Paris with my brother So'
And we're meeting CEOs
Rilès international
Labels be blowing up my phone
Empire's starting to grow
Females come but never go
Reading contracts all night long
A hundred times just to make sure
Nobody's fooling the plan, imma write it my way
California this summer, nah I don't pay the tickets
Alright, alright, it's all good, don't talk 'bout what's secret
Imma finish Rilèsundayz then you gon see it
Silence and I were friends
Fireworks made us lose the bond
Darling I figured out
Peace wasn't made for me at all..
After the darkness will come the sun
That shit I said was just a mistake
What if I burn my wings on the road?
What if I shut down lights by myself?
What if I burn my wings
If I keep going
Cuz I couldn't stop
When I had the chance
What if I do it right
And I shut it down
Ain't that enough to remain in minds?
What if I burn my wings
If I keep going
Cuz I couldn't stop
When I had the chance
What if I do it right
And I shut it down
Is that enough to remain in minds?I woke up in this life and something was strange
As if I've missed a step, as if I was in danger
But I am not Meursault, I am not a stranger
But I am not me, I am not a looser
But if that shit happens, I am not a number
So what's wrong with me, with my Skyjackers
I'm good if I don't crash the ground until the center
Teach me Master I'm gonna be a killer
In this temple
Walls painted with blood
There's no retreat
There's no defeat
You see this bitch
Give it an high kick
Right on its throat
Don't let it go
This ain't easy
No guerriero in one day
I, got arms, don't cross them
As far as my visions are
Reality
Got my weapons with me
Until they become liquid
Until the tiger quits its fury
So never, never 
My blood is mercury
,
my head is in graphene
I lift mountains, my daily routine
What's your excuse? What's your plan to leave?
You're right there's no places for all these pussies
You're right there's no places for all these bitches
I hate the way they talk, the way they believe
Between me and them, two different species
This is, the end before you even begin bitchYou're trying to teach me things
I know what I'm in
Get the fuck out my way
You're not what I need
You're trying to teach me things
You  talk, talk, talk shit
Get the fuck out my way
You're not what I need
Ok I'm good
Oh yeah I'm great
I don't need y'all niggas to tell me what to think
Oh yeah I'm fine
Ok you're fake..
You're coming at me 'cause you only see the $$$
We ain't talked for a while but now we're friends
And my exes suddenly call me 'babe'
But would you ride with me
When my reign is gone
Shout out to everybody fucking with me since day one
You're trying to be sincere
But I know you played yourself..
Be a fucking man
And tell me what you think
If you don't understand
Get the fuck outta my way
Be a fucking man
And tell me what you think
If you don't understand
Get the fuck outta my way
Wanna take a sip
Wanna wear my shoes
It's funny how it goes when you got the juice
I made it brick by brick
Walls by walls
You can't snatch the shit
I engraved in stone
You  hate my self
But you love my songs
But would you ride with me
When my reign is gone
Love for everybody fucking with me since day one
You're trying to be sincere
But you played yourself..
Be a fucking man
And tell me what you think
If you don't understand
Get the fuck outta my way
Be a fucking man
And tell me what you think
If you don't understand
Get the fuck outta my way
But would you ride with me?
When my reign is gone
Love for everybody fucking with me since day one
You're trying to be sincere
But you played yourself..
Be a fucking manIf they cut mother's ears as she wasn't free
And they sold her in front of my family
Colons raped her, then belaboured
She couldn't breathe anymore, but still ride her
Oh, too bad punctured lungs, she died on the floor
Take her teeth, body's out, given to the condor
Next my brother ripped nose from lashes on his face
Barely seeing, eyes gouged, stop it where's your faith ?
I'm a negro from Angola's Bantos tribes
Motherfucker I swear I will avenge my clan
All my brothers, sisters, friends and relatives
You killed all of them, for you all the same breed
No, no, no! Not my father, don't touch him
He's my last, He's my hand, my bones and ribs
He teaches me life and everything, I still need him
 
I swear I will avenge my family
As long as I'm still standing, breathing, on my feet
In my heart, abundant are sadness and pain
But my hatred for you, will remain the same
So I fled to Quilombo, deadly course
Thank God I'm alive, it could've been worse
But not worse than what I saw, never forget
Everytime I think about it, eyes are wet
But I stay strong, and brave
It was the creed that you taught me
Decades after, I'm a warrior of Zumbi
I'm a grown man, king of my clan and my tribes
And I'm back on this land, where they snatched your life
Free all slaves
Burn their cages
Freedom is not written
On a piece of paper
But in our blood
And in our veins
For our sacrifices
Unbearable pain
 
I swear I just avenged, my family
And I'm still, standing on my feet
In my heart, abundant are sadness and pain
But my hatred for you, will ever remain the same
