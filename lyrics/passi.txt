And everything is going to the beat
And everything is going to the beat
And everything is going
(Is go Oíche Fhéil Eoin
Oíche Fhéil Eoin
Oíche Fhéil Eoin
Oíche Fhéil Eoin
Oích-oíche Fhéil
Oíche Fheíl
Oíche Fhéil Eoin
Ní thiochfaidh mé aniar
Oíche Fhéil Eoin
Ní thiochfaidh mé aniar
Oíche Fhéil Eoin)
And you said it was like fire around the brim
Burning solid, burning thin the burning rim
Like stars burning holes right through the dark
Flicking fire like saltwater into my eyes
You were one inch from the edge of this bed
I drag you back a sleepyhead, sleepyhead
They couldn't think of something to say the day you burst
With all their lions and all their might and all their thirst
They crowd your bedroom like some thoughts wearing thin
Against the walls, against your rules, against your skin
My beard grew down to the floor and out through the doors
And of your eyes,
begonia skies like a sleepyhead, sleepyhead
Go aheadAll these kind of places
Make it seem like it's been ages
And tomorrow some new building will scrape the sky
I love this country dearly
I can feel the ladder clearly
But I never thought I'd be alone to try
Once I was outside Penn Station
Selling red and white carnations
We were still alone
My wife and I
Before we marry, save my money
Brought my dear wife over
Now I work to bring my family stateside
But off the boat they stayed a while
Then scattered across the coast
Once a year I'll see them for a week or so
At most I took a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, oh-oh-oh
I took a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, oh-oh-oh
Practice isn't perfect
But the market cuts a loss
I remind myself that times could be much worse
My wife won't ask me questions
And there's not so much to ask
And she'll never flaunt around an empty purse
Once my mother-in-law came
Just to stay a couple nights
Then decided she would stay the rest of her life
I watch my little children
Play some board game in the kitchen
And I sit and pray they never feel my strife
But then my partner called to say the pension funds were gone
He made some bad investments
Now the accounts are overdrawn
I took a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, oh-oh-oh
I took a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, oh-oh-oh
Honey it's your son
I think I borrowed just too much
We had taxes, we had bills
We had a lifestyle to front
And tonight I swear I'll come home
And we'll make love like we're young
Tomorrow you'll cook dinner
For the neighbors and their kids
We can rip apart those socialists
And all their damn taxes
You'll see I am no criminal
I'm down on both bad knees
I'm just too much a coward
To admit when I'm in need
I took a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, oh-oh-oh
I took a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, oh-oh-oh
I took a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, oh-oh-oh
I took a walk
Take a walk, take a walk, take a walk
Take a walk, oh-oh-ohShe's my sunshine in the rain
My Tylenol when I'm in pain yeah
Let me tell you what she means to me
Like a tall glass of lemonade
When it's burning hot on summer days
She's exactly what I need
She's soothing like the ocean rushing on the sand
She takes care of me baby
She helps me be a better man
She's so beautiful, sometimes I stop to close my eyes
She's exactly what I need
She's my smile when I'm feeling blue
She's my good night sleep when my day is through yeah
Let me tell you what she means to me
Kinda like the feeling after your first kiss
Except that everyday she makes me feel like this
She's exactly what I need
Oh yeah
She's soothing like the ocean rushing on the sand
She takes care of me baby
She helps me be a better man
She's so beautiful, sometimes I stop to close my eyes
She's exactly what I need
She's soothing like the ocean rushing on the sand
She takes care of me baby
She helps me be a better man
She's so beautiful, sometimes I stop to close my eyes
She's exactly what I need
She's exactly what I needSince my heart is golden
I've got sense to hold it
Tempted just to make an ugly scene
No I'm not as proper
My money's in copper
Ripped down from the brownstones to the street
Listen, I'm your friend don't quote me
But not a friend worth noting
Yes, please don't even note me as your friend
Who says we have cold hearts?
Acting out our old parts
Let's perform our favorite little scene
I get carried away, carried away from you
And I'm hoping and I'm praying
'Cause I'm sorry, sorry about that
Sorry about things that I said
Always let it get to my head
Oh a European, once again with feeling
Higher education making sense
Justify your thesis, certain that you need this
Tell me what your point is in defense
Listen, I don't really know you
And I don't think I want to
But I think I can fake it if you can
And let's agree there's no need, no more talk of money
Let's just keep pretending to be friends
I get carried away, carried away from you
And I'm hoping and I'm praying
'Cause I'm sorry, sorry about that
Sorry about the things that I said
Always let it get to my head
I get carried away, carried away from you
And I'm hoping and I'm praying
'Cause I'm sorry, sorry about that
Sorry about the things that I said
Always let it get to my head
Wake up in the morning, wake up in the evening
Wake up when you want to
'Cause no one's really watching
Well, she'll have something to say about it but
We all have problems
We're all having problems
And we've all got something to say
I get carried away, carried away from you
And I'm hoping and I'm praying
'Cause I'm sorry, sorry about that
Sorry about things that I've said
Always let it get to my head
I get carried away, carried away from you
And I'm hoping and I'm praying
'Cause I'm sorry, sorry about that
Sorry about the things that I said
Always let it get to my head
