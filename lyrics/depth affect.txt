Every clap tears you up
The words hurt and I'm bruising fate
Maybe I'm too predictable
Maybe you were never content
I just want to share every day
Maybe obsess with being obsessed
Sorry I'm so stupid and dumb
Always letting down everyone
When you create your worst fears
And now you paid a million dollars in taste and tears
I wish I could hear you laugh again and kiss your funny faces
I can't play music anymore
'cause it reminds me of him
The record crates are deep
I got a lot of dusty records to dance to
Got a lot of dusty records to dance to
Got a lot of dusty records to dance to
I was there the first time you saw snow
Thought that it would last forever
Walking in the streets of Amsterdam
With my best friend
Hoping some day we might procreate
A little baby
That kinda look like both of us
And try to provide
The soul-less system all gift-wrapped up
In a smiley text face
Mutual friend still left behind
Hopefully you'll become a respectable woman
And accomplish things
And I can't play music anymore
'cause it reminds me of him
The crates are dusty and deep
I got a lot of records to dance to
Got a lot of records to dance to
Got a lot of records to dance to
Well I was there
I was there
Your clap tears me up
Your words hurt like a bruise and fate
Maybe I'm too predictable
And I can't play music anymore
'cause it reminds me of him
These record crates are deep
Got a lot of dusty records to dance to
Got a lot of dusty records to dance to
Still got a lot of dusty records to dance to
Dusty records to dance to
Still got a lot of dusty records to dance to
Well I was there
Well I was there
Still got a lot of dusty records to dance to
Well I was thereHappiness passes
It will flee
Nevermind
Soon I will dieRhymin Riddlore from Chillin Villain Empire with DEPTH AFFECT
I wrote this song, you know
To myself and from myself
And now I share it with everybody
So, umm, check out the lyrics, you know
Some people gon't be tripping
Some people gon't act different
Some people gon't be pissed just cause they can't stand your existence
My friends tell me I'm alone too much
At home getting blown and stoned too much
And I should reach out more, I don't keep in touch enough
And the only time I shine is with the mic and a cut
If they're right, then I'm fucked
Cause I like this enough to write this up and put it on a record
When I should know better, I'm a grown ass nigga
Still hanging with homies, who knows me as the riddlore?
So show me to the liquor and the weed and I'm happy
The only thing that can top it off, is just a fat beat
The only therapy I've ever known is to rap free
It might not be your style but thats me
So let it be heard then, by all of those who are hurting
It's time to open the curtain for certain
It's to late for revers it through your imperfection
Show them all you're perfect
For the love of the art, I'm playing my part it's more than just a role
It's more than just body and mind, it's coming from the soul
Be hold, we're build an ark come in from the cold
We're traveling the globe and back to Projekt Blowed
This is your life, so live it
This is your world, go visit
Your home get out your prison
Trapped in someone else's vision
2x Hook
I open up to see what the world has to offer me
The oceans and the lakes and streams and its all for me
The hater and the snakes and the fiends get 'em off of me
I dodge and I shake and I lean till it's off of me
Cautiously, consciously, just like I rocking beats
I apply the same philosophy, when I walk the streets
Lyrics are priceless, talk is cheap
Hawkishly, they're watching and try to alter me
Too hard to categorize, package and market me
When art over money is our degree
Artistry, obviously, you'll can see, I'm nothing like those other emcees
I'm not concerned with the kilo price
I'd rather make music in the key of life
But must I be crucified like Jesus Christ
For you to take off your blind and see the light?
2x Pre-Hook
This is your life, so life it
This is your world, go visit
Your home get out your prison
Trapped in someone else's visionHello, open doors
Come on, honey, you're new to this
Red rum all over the place storms a brute witch
Can't be stopped, to the top of the Towers Of Babel
The capital of cowards who shower themselves with superpowers
I reign supreme in this reign of things
Superficial mistle of material goods you fling dream
All your money at, son, put it all on black 
You go on about how you love money, how you love that?
Now, flip you like a bird, nigga, put you in the back
Throw you in seran wrap, now we makin' cash
Killin' my community but now I've got some rims
High-rise or big bits, that's how I live
Custom alligator interior, what I did
Sold their momma a hit but now look at the kids
Am I just a fresh depth of dopeboy hero or just another dumb nigga killin' of his people?
But who am I too judge what others do beacuse their shoes dont fit my feet
Velvet lined slippers to the hardest of cleats
Think, Elohean, for a moment of peace
Hallelijuah, yo
I robot, not, shot sherriff, woah
Mouth full of gun powder sweet, nigga blow go
March to a different drum, the drummerboy sung I didn't know he had it in him
Poetry in motion, run!
Got metaphor to escape tragedy
Crack sale, blackmail had to be consequence
Had to be consequence
Midnight in a perfect world, lookin' for a savior turning to the end of artic children for some paper
What about community? My people need some answers
Dont want to do wrong but my baby needs Pampers
Dont want to do wrong but the Chevy needs some rims
The latter statement is just a nigga commitin' sins
Time and time again, watch the cycle begin
Selling your love short to ruin your next kin
