But standing in water up to their knees
Three very unimportant little people were doing the best they could with an idea
And that's about all they had
And I don't know
Maybe that night these three people were making history
But anyway what I'm tryna tell you folks is:
Here we are
Huh, shit
We're getting up, we're getting up
Chinese Man, wassup?
Get up to get down, get up to get down
Get up to get down, get up to get down
Get, get up, get up, get, get up, get up
Get, get down
French Coast , so active
What it is
Get up, get up to get down
Get up, get out, you lazy lout
Get into your working clothes
Up to your knees in oil and grease
With the grindstone to your nose
Get up, get out, you lazy lout
Get into your working clothes
Up to your knees in oil and grease
With the grindstone to your nose
Get up, up
Get up, get out and get your stock up
Find a group of chickens sippin' get the flock drunk
Contribute to the party treat it like a potluck
You best believe I'm gettin' up tomahawk dunk
We gotta suit up, then clock in and go work
Grinding hard as I ain't strikin' 'til my toes hurt
And ain't no secret ain't no need to be so covert
I keep it straight up, most of y'all ain't go no vert
Let's keep it real
We gotta move to keep the wheels rollin'
And rock until our heels swollen
And walk until they feel broken
And stopping for no blockin' obstacle just like a real trojan
Why ya'll swervin' faded like you drink banana peel potion
Get off the gravel and just quit the moanin'
'Cause I am never slippin', homie, ya'll be trippin' slowly
Why? Y'all the hoarders steady lying in the clutter
It's easy to look up when your mind's in the gutter
Get up, get out, you lazy lout
Get into your working clothes
Up to your knees in oil and grease
With the grindstone to your nose
Get up, get out, you lazy lout
Get into your working clothes
Up to your knees in oil and grease
With the grindstone to your nose
Get up
I can't because I'm signed in France to Chinese Man
Euros when I cash my advance
And I got sexy dimes with fans
I can't pronounce their names
But they legs spread like a fan
To catch when the rockers are rolling through the country
I'll stay up and start throwing kicks like Chun-Li
Can't cramp my style I'm flowing like a monthly
Period  for sure I'll put it bluntly
Buttons on my jacket like I'm in the Sex Pistols
Straight  she flexible
Stay like a rhino on a credit card
I'll make a charge, nose to the grindstone
But I ain't a mason, nah
I live a comfortable life
Smoke a blunt with a pint of Stella just to unwind
Vision clear as my voice when I uncover the mic
Like a tiger or a skater I get up on the grind
Get up, get out, you lazy lout
Get into your working clothes
Up to your knees in oil and grease
With the grindstone to your nose
Get up, get out, you lazy lout
Get into your working clothes
Up to your knees in oil and grease
With the grindstone to your nose
Get up
Get up, get out, you lazy lout
Get into your working clothes
Up to your knees in oil and grease
With the grindstone to your nose
Get up, get out, you lazy lout
Get into your working clothes
Up to your knees in oil and grease
With the grindstone to your nose
Get up這故事到處有香車和美人
在這裡我扮演發生的可能
這故事到處有香車和美人
在這裡我扮演發生的可能
No me nuh carry no gun
Inna me pack it’s strictly musical
Weapon not in me style
And fashion, call me lyrical
T-AI-WAN
Cool like I an’
Stronger than Goliath
Like David starts a riot
Yo, G like Taiwan
Make number one Tai smoker
MC stomp on, ‘n call my lyrics murder
Grand King Taiwan
Cool and deadly officer
Lift up the mind, they call me Jack the Rinser
Ah, we rinse it, rinse it, rinse it up proper
Turn up the sound and push up the master
Musical slaughter, they call disaster
Chaos they set the whole place ‘pon fire
Fire burn them, impostors and traitors
No me nuh want no more of them two-faced liars
Tell them we are tired are you kill this menace
Now I wanna deal with music creator…
汽車展覽會每年都舉行
陳列各種新車五花八門
Drop concise wisdom and vision when I represent the time
Feeling blessed in this profession when the stress is left behind
Testing my progression, how the intellect’s designed
Found escape within the tape deck, inspiration, press rewind
Sending energy on reminiscing vibe
Felt the wisdom in the rhythm through the television’s eyes
Felt deception, pressure when the people equal hatred
So I get in the grooves like Chinese Man, a needle placement
Basic vocabulary turned to complex rhetoric
Treble mixed with bass and it became poetic medicine
Veterans paved the path that is now a flashback
My introduction to the game is training for the last track
Backpacks began at the plan that we had established
But the canvas in the hands of the masses to rock the planet
Cause a mass panic, wreck havoc and control the melody
With correct weaponry we can place our soul in destiny

Once upon a time in this great land
European settlers would set off on a cave man quest
Dutch king summoning Jan Van Beek...
The rest was Queen Elizabeth conquest
As portrayed quite well by Cate Blanchett
Great actress, wait I may digress !
Before that was pyramids and villages where pigmy little men and other such denizens rest
Complex systems of living some fishing some building and others out killing
Matriarchy where the kings were tribe women
Painted art still seen today in tribe Symbols
Its a cycle your beginning is your ending and your interim
Your appearance is a historic coincidence
But they link it to your incorrect conditioning
Now everybody screaming racism as a consequence
:
Bring out the marching band
Let ‘em play an anthem for our continent
You went & botched the plan
Liberate the mind, but forgot the land
Bring out the marching band
Let ‘em play an anthem for our continent
Why you dun' botch the plan
Liberate the land, but forgot the man
He bought a range but his aim’s off for the plane
But it ain’t take off JFK straight shot
Great Lakes paying for it, hate makes the air foggy
NSA takes notice, play it safe same result
So David Blane got the rainbow sold to y’all
You can rise away till the Neuralizer tapers off
Break a law, take a farm you get our your acres I’d sooner root for that than a handout with the arms embargo
It’ll be my own Zimbabwe so Colin Powell will swallow my bow and arrow and follow that
With his strolls and angle to photograph
My ass know a power to recover from all of that, NASTY
All about poverty playing that off happy
Skin too thick in the middle tin o’ acne cream or vaseline
You wait till them Somali kids
Give you a take from that Bruce Wayne alley scene
Bring out the marching band
Let' em play an anthem for our continent
You went & botched the plan
Liberate the mind, but forgot the land When I was young and under ten
A silly wee fool was I
The morning that I left the school
I heard my mother cry
Chorus:
Get up, get out, you lazy lout
Get into your working clothes
Up to your knees in oil and grease
And a grindstone to your nose
I bought me a clock, a pretty good clock
To help me to tell the time
It awakened me every morning
With a very poetic rhyme
I married me a wife, a pretty good wife
And kept her many a year
Come what may, she'd begin each day
By whispering in my ear
Now some get to lie as long as they like
They're luckier men than me
I never get to lie very long
I'm only four foot threeEverybody run run run 
Everybody scatter scatter 
Everybody run run run
There they go
There they go
There they go..
You rocking with the blue gang
They came to shoot, they cold
Tase the fools and use they votes
You think so too folks
Close your throat
Blows leave a dude's face broke
I make a full race
Like Usain Bolt
And you stay broke
But they will shut up and yield
They suffering from something that's real
Getting shot in the field
Jotting the names
Of lives that the government's killed
They fighting with
Picket signs while you're shoving with shills
Circle around
Search a turbulent crowd
You're allowed to murder a child
Smirking a smile
Pow!
Pound me til I'm purple and brown
Turn that shit 'round
Like the outcome of the Ferguson Trial
Now
Pardon me man
Are you part of the clan?
How many bodies you slam?
How many men have you wanted to hang?
Goddamn you break the law 'cuz you can
You got permission 'cuz the system's in the palm of your hand
Once shot a guy's marks
Hide behind badges
Badder guy's blood
The youth fights for their rights
But cannot fight slugs
You sit and just watch them all scatter like bugs
There they go
Everybody run run run
There they go
Everybody scatter scatter
There they go
Everybody run run run
There they go
There they go
There they go..
Your whole gang, stage front
Enslaves youngers for sports
Spray slugs at a young boy
Starts handcuffing the corpse
Remorseless
No bother to face judges in court
The more you kill
The more you gain love and support
It's appalling
Stealing people's lives
My blood is pouring
The poor got a reason to rise
Yet they bodies falling
Officer put down your gun and forfeit
Say, 'fuck the force'
Before you end up bucking your own brother for it
Don't blame the martyr
I play with karma
I pray to god your baby daughter
Is caught up in some crazy drama
And has to face your partners
Who raise the law
And aim revolvers at her face
And start to spray shit on her
POP POP POP
Right in your daughter's head
She pouring red
Legs shaking on the corner dead
And when they take this to court
Will you support the feds?
Or get revenge
And face your friends from the force instead?
Once shot a guy's marks
Hide behind badges, badder guy's blood
The youth fights for their rights
But cannot fight slugs
You sit and just watch them all scatter like bugs
There they go
Everybody run run run
There they go
Everybody scatter scatter
There they go
Everybody run run run
There they go
There they go
There they go..
Somebody that get paid to do right did wrong
No I don't accept his apology
No I could care less about his condolences
He's still working
He's still getting a pay check
He's still feeding his kids
And my husband is six feet under
And I'm looking for a way to feed my kids nowYou have power and money
But you are mortal
You know cannot escape death
But immortality can be obtained

Children of the night
What music they make
Today, we're gonna speak on the subject of liars
You know, when we think about liars we think about
Cheaters, deceivers, con artists, anything
In that vein but
The main thing that they have all in common is fear
Just think about it
Liar, liar, pants on fire
Hang your laundry on the wire
Little money in your pocket and some hustling on the game
If you wanna ride free you better find another way
Take it down, better make it down the way you know
Fellas on the left, ladies looking ready to go
Liar, liar, liar, liar
Liar, liar, liar, liar
Liar, liar, liar, liar
Liar, liar, liar, liar
Yeah
Let me get on this mic real quick
Check it out
Dug yourself in a hole but you can't find a way to get out now
Six feet in the ground, ash to ashes but you can't climb out
They say if it's done in the dark it's gon' come to light
Maybe hidden for a while but rises fully to plain sight
The naked eye won't see it all
Hope they believe it all
You fiending more but when they keep your people you proceed to fall
Turn the other cheek, you hope that you could sleep at all
Wake up in the morning quiet but you dreamed applause
You been smilin' outside but inside you just feel appalled
The devil is a liar, look in the mirror, see the cause
Mary, Mary, quite contrary
Lifestyle contradictive
Said you'd do it for the pleasure, don't care about the business
But I know it ain't my business
So I throw these middle fingers up
Read between my ring and index finger
I don't give a fuck
Liar, liar, tell me what it is you tryna be
I'll listen to your story but promise you ain't foolin' me
Liar, liar, liar, liar
Liar, liar, liar, liar
Liar, liar, liar, liar
Liar, liar, liar, liar
Drama, drama, always acting
Shut them off if no one's watching
Tall tree climbing up to nowhere
Cut the vine and watch it wither
Looking so nice, looking like you're ready to go
Baby if it's on us, maybe let's get ready to go
Liar, liar, liar, liar
Liar, liar, liar, liar
Liar, liar, liar, liar
Liar, liar, liar, liar
So today
We learned about the phonies, the fabricators
You know
The little tricksters out there
We just wanna chill out with all that lyin'
You know what I mean?
Because the truth will set you free
You know what I mean?
You just gon'...
Fade outWhat? Unh! Oh Well
They say what they say
Uh-huh
But they do what they do
What about you?
They said what they said
Anyway
They did
OK! Ha! Yo!
It a'int testin' my patience
If you question my greatness
Fans will never debate this
Fuck your revelations
Brains changed
Through the chemical agents
I'm brave mane
Better than those
Who never would say shit
They poppin' they lip off
And they often will flip flop
Kill 'em and resurrect 'em
When they coffin get ripped off
Cats easily fall back
I can call that
Immediately all whack
Get your balls back
The world keeps spinning
These twenty four hours
As the earth keeps moving
Bodies three sixty fives
There's more galaxies
Than there's sand on the beach
And I think the universe
Wants me to see the lies
What I want more than anything
Is my trees legalized
Yea that's the way
At least a dab a day
Sunday to Saturday
Suckers be
Looking for
Notoriety
Tryin' me
But they dyin'
Silently
Trying to see
How pious that I could be
They say what they say
They do what they do
But I'ma keep it true
What about you?
They said what they said
Did what they did
But we gonna keep
It raw with this true spit
No deal on substance
No frills
Dope deals
Dope skills on mics
That broke steel
No damage
So Oaklandish
Deep rooted
In the town
Where we compound soul
And street music
Underground dub
Local to bicoastal
To global
Off a load of
Dope potables
Colder than fly vocals
And the uncontrollable urge
To expose the Pinocchios
They bullshit with clowns
This a'int my first rodeo
Polio carriers a'int got a leg to stand on
I'm slappin' empty pockets like I'm practicin' handbone
First person quick scopin'
Tryin' to get my camp on
But addressin' the real
In every letter I put my stamp on
Headphones blastin' like a drummer in my brain
But Katniss got you thinkin' that my hunger is a game
So when I catch firewires they runnin' from the flame
You bastards ass backwards you goin' against the grain
They say what they say
They do what they do
But I'ma keep it true
What about you?
They said what they said
Did what they did
But we gonna keep
It raw with this true spit
Suckers be
Looking for
Notoriety
Tryin' me
I'm brave mane
Better than those
Who never would say shit
No frills
Dope deals
Dope skills on mics
That broke steel
OK!
People be leaking and thinkin' they strong
When they really weak and not peepin' them
Look at me, get why they tweakin'
But then
I begin speakin'
Some of the things
That my pen be leakin'
Even English comedy brings
The song that I'm singin'
Is swingin'
And I hope you get the meanin'
Even if it's a
Minor inconvenience
That's my word
You say it then display it
Action verb
Engrave it in the pavement
Just to make it concrete
And to let 'em know
That I'm hella indelible
I live my life to the beat
I'm too nice
To have to be nice
But before I knew that shit
I paid a hell of a price
Everybody got an impurity
Call the security
Speak freely and
Cure the disease
With ease
That's the common denominator
That made a nominal figure greater
And degraded the drama of a hater!
They say what they say
They do what they do
But I'ma keep it true
What about you?
They said what they said
Did what they did
But we gonna keep
It raw with this true spit
They say what they say
They do what they do
But I'ma keep it true
What about you?
They said what they said
Did what they did
But we gonna keep
It raw with this true spit
And they've answered to the drama that a dame said
Show respect to this time past
Oakland niggas showin niggas
Patrollin' these mics while he's aimin' his Tec
Hahahahaha
HahahahahahahahahaIn my room
Way at the end of the hall
I sit and stare at the wall
Each day is just like the next

Liberate the land, but forgot the man
Feel the momentum of an unspent force
A liberation found another one get lost
Magazine kept while the gun get tossed
Perpetual previsions of the sunset clause
No wonder they demand more
Nobody planned for
Brazilian cuts in the pubic crotch of the land court
In a Mexican stand-off
Picture a poverty stricken finger
Twitching on hair pin trigger
And pause…
Can’t deny my stress
I know better than to blame, the wild Wild West
As to reign the higher address as a mind set
Bigger the jail, the less serious the crimes get
So the tumbleweed rolls through these empty streets
They shot the sheriff all we have is the deputy
And he definitely does not went to rock the boats
So we work hard chopping, bloat, and forget we plead

Que no puedo más con este olvido
¿Habrá razones bellas para este adiós?
Asomo la cabeza para ver el sol
Siempre vas a estar
Siempre estás, vida
Siempre vas a estar
Siempre, siempre, siempre, siempre estás
Ucha cómo me duele el olvido
Ucha cómo te extraño mi amor
Tanto que nos quisimos, tan lindos
Tan rápido te fuiste mi amor
¿Habrá razones bellas para este adiós?
Asomo la cabeza para ver el sol
Siempre vas a estar
Siempre estás, vida
Siempre vas a estar
Siempre, siempre, siempre, siempre estás
Tantas veces soñamos juntitos
Tantos años cantamos de amor
Es que tu amorcito fue abrigo
Es que hoy me congelo, mi amor
¿Habrá razones bellas para este adiós?
Asomo la cabeza para ver el sol
Siempre vas a estar
Siempre estás, vida
Siempre vas a estar
Siempre, siempre, siempre, siempre estásWell you
Give me hope in my heart
To pull apart the stitches in the dark
Where I lay on my own
There's nothing left to do but take this home
These skies never seemed so grey
These skies never seemed so grey
These skies never seemed so grey
These skies never seemed so grey
I need to get away
I need to get away
I need to get away
Don't act like you're speaking truth
When you got nothing to say
Why you making this hard for me?
And why'd you walk away?
This one's for the people that would find it hard to breath
This one's for the poor, for the beaten and diseased
This one's for the people that are poorly in their head
This one's for the masses
This one's for the people that are up all night, barely sleeping
This is for the dreamers that are still dreaming
At 5am, I need to get to bed and i'll be right again
This one's for the youths with their empty cupboards
This one's for the families that were lacking mothers
This one's for the families that were lacking fathers
But still they'd harness, enough love to bridge their dramas
This one's for the beaten down and broken
This one's for the people with them broken hearts
This one's for the people that can't leave their beds
This one's for the masses
These skies never seemed so grey
These skies never seemed so grey
These skies never seemed so grey
These skies never seemed so grey
I need to get away
I need to get away
Don't act like you're speaking truth
When you got nothing to say
Why you making this hard for me ?
And why'd you walk away ?
Ain't nothing better than feeling happiness in silence
Comfort in your skin, supreme bliss, its the nicest
Glass of fine wine and grade, quick aeroplane to Spain
For Paella plates and grapes. Summertime skates in capes
Superhero shit, put a wasteman in a place
Lay and rest your face for disrespecting Dave
They can't interrupt my wave, can't block my sunlight
Soul on the sleeve, let's all vibe and hum nice
Sing the same song, move in unison for a minute
I think we all need better, ain't nobody grinning
Quarter past 6, thinking pub food and pints fam
Argue with the wise men, we'll engulf all your pies manDown 2.68 points, Empire Gas

I believe with all of my heart that it is a contributing factor to our juvenile delinquency of today by a hundred percent believe. Why I believe that is because I know how it feels when you sing it. I know what it does to you. And I know of the evil feeling that you feel when you sing it. And I know the ... the ... lost position that you get into ... and the beat ... well ... uhmm ... if you talk to the average teenager of today and you ask them what it is about rock 'n roll music that they like, and the first thing that they'll say, is the beat, the beat, THE BEAT!!!From Cape Cod Light to the Mississip, to San Francisco Bay
They're talking about this famous place, down Greenwich Village way
And so I got my banjo out, just sittin', catchin' dust
And painted right across the face "Greenwich Village or Bust."
And so I got my banjo out, just sittin' and catchin' dust

I said "Goodbye, Kansas, Mo, and hello, Washington Square!"Ha, faite moi feuille de rose
Prenez en pitié mon aveux
C'est une langue que je veux
C'est mon cul que je vous propose
You suck me ! Ha
On peut affirmer une chose 
C'est que ton con, vivant et rose
N'est que le con d'une putain
Yeah
Et j'ai gardé très peu de hanche
Afin de pouvoir exhiber
Le tralala le plus bombé des tralala
You suck ma ! Ha
Ha, faite moi feuille de rose
Prenez en pitié mon aveux
C'est une langue que je veux
C'est mon cul que je vous propose29 heures durant
Quasiment ininterrompues
Nous avons livré bataille
29 heures durant
Quasiment ininterrompues
Nous avons livré bataille
Pied à Pied
Dans des conditions difficiles
Face à un adversaire tenace, intransigeant
Mais tout de même, suffisamment ébranlé par la grève générale
And the finder of lost children
And I will strike down upon thee with great vengeance and fuuuuuurious anger
Nous avons posé devant l'ensemble de la population une question
La réponse des manifestants à été dans un cris unanime, "Liberons nos camarades"
Fuuuurious anger
Le gouvernement n'est pas capable de prendre ses responsabilités sur cette question
C'est la population qui doit prendre cette responsabilité
Fuuuuurious anger
Thos who attempt to poison and destroy my brothers and you will know my name is the Lord when I lay my vengeance upon theeI don't really like the biggest song
Find it silly not original
Condescending and a little wrong
Tired of pretending I am with it but...
MAYBE Y'ALL LIKE IT BETTER THAT WAY
Gotta miss me with biggest song
Cuz I don't listen when the shit come on
You got me twisted if you think I am for it
So pardon me when I just switch it off
MAYBE Y'ALL LIKE IT BETTER THAT WAY
I know this kid that gets laughed at
Slandered and trashed
Cuz he lacks the manners to adapt to hash tags
Branded an outcast like one half of OutKast
Gotta handle demands a thousand times stacked up
He won't pander, animated like Jack Black
And he made it past the approximate age of Black Jack
So when the radio plays another bad band
MAYBE Y'ALL LIKE IT BETTER THAT WAY
Hey life is abstract
There's no accounting for taste
Drink at a fast enough rate to get you passed out
He likes them dance tracks
Something about em is great
Get in a trance, later
Language is matter fact
Standards are half assed
Now whose to say what is great?
50 shades of grey
Ana Steel/and I'm still the black cat
Really I am baffled, sounding like an asshole
MAYBE Y'ALL LIKE IT BETTER THAT WAY
B-side rocker not a in dem playlist
Music what we sing is just too dynamic
Dynamite explosion when we chat pon version
We don't adapt, and we don't edit, we don't seek attention
We just.. do what we do, we just and do it and we do it
We don't.. need your advice we just a sing it cause we like it
Gimme.. the pen & paper weed & the rizla
Play that riddim let me light up the fire now
Too many MC's seeking for dough, seeking for fame
They so low, they so lame
We all know their music will be going down the drain
One day, right about now you getting plays
Tomorrow being played, yo, listen what we say
Oh!
We not inna dem ting no!
New styles we are bring yo
Maybe not the most famous!
But we sure say we dangerous!
We not inna dem ting no!
New styles we are bring yo
Maybe not the most famous!
But we sure say we dangerous
For every innovator
There are 60 imitators
For every real gators
Cheaper fakers
For every pop station
Trying to play this
There's a major label head
Tryna to payola his way into the playlist
20 times a day shit
For every liberator
Secret agents
For every cliché
Syndication
And every single day
It's the same lame thing playing
Then again...
MAYBE Y'ALL LIKE IT BETTER THAT WAY
We not inna dem ting no!
New styles we are bring yo
Maybe not the most famous!
But we sure say we dangerous
I don't really like the biggest song
Find it silly not original
Condescending and a little wrong
Tired of pretending I am with it but...
MAYBE Y'ALL LIKE IT BETTER THAT WAY
Gotta miss me with the biggest song
Cuz I don't listen when the shit come on
You got me twisted if you think I am for it
So pardon me when I just switch it off...
Tell me oh Muse of that ingenius hero who travelled far and wide
Many cities did he visit
And many worthy nations with who's manners and customs he was acquainted
Moreover he suffered much by sea world trying to save his own life
And bring his man savely home ]

Everyday another weed strain, clouding up my foogie brain tryna blank it out from these heavy chains
Another stress nother dam pain, sucking on my dam veins kinda like the anal with the shit stains
Poker face when I'm On game never show my girl shame

Dr. Lecter with the extra girth
Rank a wurst from best to worst

Shift the malediction once inflicted on Egyptian acquisitions

Astonishing agility riddle me how these kids display the synergy
Typically only seen in synchronicity of swimming teams

More styles than there's feet upon a millipede

Stencil clean, seen, must be P and Mr. Green
In an out, twinkle feet, stealthy like a ninja team
Any bwoy test get injested by the lit machine
Groove Sessions.. Huge spectrum of shrewd lessons
Tear the crude cretins a new rectum
Awake from slumber thunder rages now torrentially
This shit is fucking dope the understatement of the century

It's the Xbox expert holding a game while he his change clothes
And if it ain't a dig to your chin then blood your holding 8 blows
A kick wearing my timbs, some rotten fruit at your range rove
Fat like I got some bombs underneath my raincoat blowing up the gaff like a terrorist in a pay phone

Always working in the gym with them protein shakes
So when we bun up the dance and make the crowd irate
It's like a muthafuckin cardio and I feel great mate
The bass bins bootin and the head top breaks
With all the gal dem on the floor and all the jelly dun shakes
We cause an earthquake till the neighbour calls jakes
The late night till the morning with the snow flakes
Hitting the roads, getting it in then I'm gone
Spitting the flows, ever so cold, like rahted
Doing it sick, doing it big, like rahted
Been on the job, been on the grind like wow
Wallet all fat, bout to bust like rahted
Creps and garms on check like wow

People pissing on the stairs, you know they just don't care
I can't take the smell, I can't take the noise
Got no money to move out, I guess I got no choice
Rats in the front room, roaches in the back
Junkies in the alley with the baseball bat
I tried to get away, but I couldn't get far
Cause a man with a tow-truck repossessed my car
Don't push me cause I'm close to the edge
I'm trying not to lose my head, ah huh-huh-huh
It's like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under, ah huh-huh-huh
Standing on the front stoop, hangin' out the window
Watching all the cars go by, roaring as the breezes blow
Dans un petit plat à part
 du sang de lézard
La valeur d'un dé à coudre
Et un peu de sucre en poudre!
Crazy lady livin' in a bag
Eating out of garbage pails, used to be a fag-hag
Said she danced the tango, skipped the light fandango
The Zircon Princess seemed to lost her senses
Down at the peepshow, watching all the creeps
So she can tell the stories to the girls back home
She went to the city and got social security
She had to get a pimp, she couldn't make it on her own
It's like a jungle sometimes it makes me wonder
How I keep from going under
Pâtisserie empoisonnée
La valeur d'un dé à coudre
Et un peu de sucre en poudre!
My brother's doing bad on my mother's TV
She says: "You watch it too much, it's just not healthy!"
"All My Children" in the daytime, "Dallas" at night
Can't even see the game or the Sugar Ray fight
The bill collectors they ring my phone
And scare my wife when I'm not home
Got a bum education, double-digit inflation
I can't take the train to the job, there's a strike at the station
Neon King Kong standin' on my back
Can't stop to turn around, broke my sacrophiliac
A mid-ranged migraine, cancered membrane
Sometimes I think I'm going insane, I swear I might hijack a plane
Le pudding à l'arsenic

Chinese Man 
Morning Sun the re-do 
I've learned so much in my travels all over the world 
Come to appreciate life more, life is beautiful 
From the ghettos of East New York 
To globe trottin' 
Life, lessons, curses and blessings
I sit back, ponder the universe’s greatest questions
What if we were judged by our heart's orientation?
Not, sex, complexion, religion or nation?
Would we still have starvation?
Would we still kill to prove our God is the God of creation?
Would the greedy stay fat from the labor of the poor?
Would war mean more than the spoils of war?
Would the truth be a guiding force?
Would peace and love be the source that plans our life course?
Would prison be packed to the brim with men, and
Would we execute them for a life of sin?
Would my good friend kill my another good friend?
Would one be in the ground and one in the pen?
Would there be a such thing as a gun?
These are questions I ask when I sit under the morning sun
Depression, recession, obsession
Where is God? You think blasphemous I'm asking this question
Transgression, Suppression, Regression
A little suggestion for self-reflection
Aggression, Obsessions, Positions
Where is God? You think blasphemous I'm asking this question
Can I make a little suggestion, I think the answer's in self-reflection
I contemplate, why do we hate?
Is evil cultivated or a sin of my friend innate?
People pray for iconic escape, God's return date
Until then what's the world's fate?
Could we live in harmony without the threat of hell?
Or do you go to heaven for dying in 9/11?
Poverty, corruption, over-consumption, mass-production, mass-destruction
Is survival our only function?
If the world so cold then what's the purpose of a man's soul?
What's a man true goal? Is it to eat good, have sex and collect gold?
Little children suffer horrors untold
All across the globe, mothers are raped, their babies are sold
Could different cultures live as one?
These are questions I ask when I sit under the mourning son
These are questions I ask when I sit under the morning sun
Depression, recession, obsession
Where is God? You think blasphemous I'm asking this question
Transgression, Suppression, Regression
A little suggestion for self-reflection

- Chinese Man Ft. A-Plus, Pep Love & Knobody 
Intro:
What. Uh
They say what they say, do what they do
But I'm a keep it true, what about you?
They said what they said, did what they did
Okey
Verse1:
Hah, yo. It ain't testin' my patience
If you question my greatness
Fans will never debate this, fuck yo revelations
Brains change through the chemical agents
I'm brave man, better than those who never will say shit
They poppin' they lip off and they often will flip flop
Kill'em and resurrect em when they caugh
And get ripped off
Cats easily fall back, I can't call that
Immediately all wack
Get your balls back
The world keeps spinnin' these 24 hours
As the earth keeps movin'
Bodies 365
There's more galaxies than the sand on the beach
And I think the universe wants me to see the lies
What I want more than anything
Is my trees legalized
Yeah, that's the way it is, it's every day
Sunday to Saturday
Suckers be lookin' for notoriety Tryin' me
But they dying silently Try'na see how biased that I could be
Chorus:
They say what they say, do what they do
But I'm a keep it true, what about you?
They said what they said, did what they did
But we gon' keep it raw with this true
This true, this true
This true, this true
Verse2:
Yo, no deal all substance no thrills
Dope deals, dope skills on mikes
And broke steel, no damage
So oaklandish, deep rooted in the town
Where we compound soul and street music
Underground up, local to bi-coastal to global
Off a load of dope portables
Colder than fly vocals
In the uncontrollable urge to expose the Pinocchio
They bullshit with clowns
This ain't my first rodeo
Polio carriers ain't got a leg to stand on
I'm slappin' empty pockets
Like I'm practicing hambone
First person quick scope at tryin' to get my camp on
But addressin' the real in every letter
I put my stamp on
Headphones blastin' like a drummer in my brain
But Katniss got you thinkin' that my hunger is a game
So when I catch fire, wives they runnin' from the flame
You bastards ass back once you goin' against
The grain
Chorus:
They say what they say, do what they do
But I'm a keep it true, what about you?
They said what they said, did what they did
But we gon' keep it raw with this true spit
Suckers be lookin' for notoriety Tryin' me
Brave man, better than those
Who never will say shit
Dope deals, dope skills on mikes
And broke steel
Verse3:
Okay
People be leakin' and thinkin' they strong
When they really weak
And I'm peepin', I'm lookin' peaky
While they tricky
But then, I begin speakin'
Some of the things that might been
Releakin, even when there's drama to bring
The song that I'm singin', it's swingin'
And I hope you get the meanin'
Even if it's a minor inconvenience
That's my word, say it and then display it
Action, verb and gravement in the pavement
Just to make it concrete
And to let 'em know that I'm hella indelible
Livin' my life to the beat
I'm too nice to have to be nice
And before I knew that shit
I paid a hell of a price
Everybody got a impurity, call the security
Speak freely and you can cure your disease, with ease
That's the common denominator
That made the nominal figure greater
And degraded the drama of a hater
Chorus:
They say what they say, do what they do
But I'm a keep it true, what about you?
They said what they said, did what they did
But we gon' keep it raw with this true spit
They say what they say, do what they do
But I'm a keep it true, what about you?
They said what they said, did what they did
But we gon' keep it raw with this true spit
