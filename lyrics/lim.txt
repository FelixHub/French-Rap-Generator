I need to not pick up my phone
I'll go straight to airplane mode
Find something to do, alone
I can be a little bit cold
But my third eye is going blind
I'm unaligned with my body and mind
It's playing tricks, I say I'm fine
But really, it's hurting me deep inside
'Cause I've been dreaming 'bout you, ooh
I've been wishing that I was next to you, ah
I've been dreaming of us, oh
I've been thinking that this is not a need or a must, but
Love has treated me so, so wrong
This year all I've got to show are songs
And I want to be super duper true to you
But God, I don't know what to do
'Cause last year I was just 22
Feels like it up and flew
So far away, and out of view
But 23 seems like me and you
'Cause I've been dreaming 'bout you, ooh
I've been wishing I was next to you, ooh
I've been dreaming of us, ah
I've been thinking this is not a need or a must, but
I know sometimes I make you feel insane
Sorry, that's just how I play this stupid game
I can't act like a child and disobey
All that you want from me and that you say
I'm sorry, baby, please,
puppy
I'm trying to be ultra mega happy
And show you my smile
, and send you my feelings
And fuck, it is so hard, being so damn far
I guess I'll just stay here and stay singing in my car?
I'll sing in my car
I've been dreaming 'bout you, ooh
I've been wishing I was next to you, ooh
I've been dreaming of us, oh
I've been thinking this is not a need or a must, but
I've been waiting on you, ooh
I've been waiting for you to tell me those three words too
'Cause I've been hoping it's true, ooh
That one day I'll feel like I am something real for you
Somethin' real for you, somethin' real for you...
Somethin' real for you, somethin' real for you...Turn around
Look at what you see
In her face
The mirror of your dreams
Make believe I'm everywhere
I'm hidden in the lines
Written on the pages
Is the answer to a neverending story
Ah
Reach the stars
Fly a fantasy
Dream a dream
And what you see will be
Rhymes that keep their secrets
Will unfold behind the clouds
And there upon a rainbow
Is the answer to a neverending story
Ah
Story
Ah
Show no fear
For she may fade away
In your hand
The birth of a new day
Rhymes that keep their secrets
Will unfold behind the clouds
And there upon a rainbow
Is the answer to a neverending story
Ah
Neverending story
Ah
Neverending story
Ah
Neverending story
Ah
