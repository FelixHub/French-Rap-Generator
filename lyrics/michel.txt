Some people long for a life that is simple and planned
Tied with a ribbon
Some people won't sail the sea 'cause they're safer on land
To follow what's written
But I'd follow you to the great unknown
Off to a world we call our own
Hand in my hand
And we promised to never let go
We're walking a tightrope
High in the sky
We can see the whole world down below
We're walking a tightrope
Never sure, never know how far we could fall
But it's all an adventure
That comes with a breathtaking view
Walking a tightrope
With you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
With you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
With you
Mountains and valleys, and all that will come in between
Desert and ocean
You pulled me in and together we're lost in a dream
Always in motion
So I risk it all just to be with you
And I risk it all for this life we choose
Hand in my hand
And you promised to never let go
We're walking a tightrope
High in the sky
We can see the whole world down below
We're walking a tightrope
Never sure, will you catch me if I should fall?
Well, it's all an adventure
That comes with a breathtaking view
Walking a tightrope
With you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
With you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
With you
With you, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
With you, ooh-ooh-ooh
With youHit the lights
Can't let no one see me get down
It's alright
I know they think I get around
You and I
Got something they can't know about
Really only heaven knows my heart
You know this ain't an ordinary love
We got so much histray in the stories about us
So come on over baby
We gon' light some candles tonight
Very special
We gon' do whatever you like
Very special
Got some henney chillin' on ice
Very Special
Hope you make the rest of my life
Very Special
Very Special
All Night
Warm my bed
It's a little cold on your shoulder
Mama said
I will understand when I'm older
In my head
Even if you tell me it's over
I'll pretend you told me I'm your all
You know this ain't an ordinary love
We got so much histray in the stories about us
So come on over baby
We gon' light some candles tonight
Very special
We gon' do whatever you like
Very special
Got some henney chillin' on ice
Very Special
Hope you make the rest of my life
Very Special
Very Special
All Night
He ain't suppose to be with you
That's what everybody gon' tell me
But I really can't count on what everybody gon' tell me
She ain't seen her baby in couple days, and I'm looking at my baby right up in his face
Flowers and gifts, restaurants
I swear he buy me anythang I want
That's why I'm so quick to
Put that music on for him, listen to it baby!
We gon' light some candles tonight
Very special
We gon' do whatever you like
Very special
Got some henney chillin' on ice
Very Special
Hope you make the rest of my life
Very Special
Very Special
All NightAnd now I'm all alone again nowhere to go
No one to turn to
Without a home, without a friend
Without a face so say hello to
And now the night is near
Now I can make believe he's here
Sometimes I walk alone at night
When everybody else is sleeping
I think of him and then I'm happy
With the company I'm keeping
The city goes to bed
And I can live inside my head
On my own, pretending he's beside me
All alone, I walk with him 'til morning
Without him, I feel his arms around me
And when I lose my way I close my eyes
And he has found me
In the rain, the pavement shines like silver
All the lights are misty in the river
In the darkness, the trees are full of starlight
And all I see is him and me forever
And forever
And I know it's only in my mind
That I'm talking to myself and not to him
And although I know that he is blind
Still I say, there's a way for us
I love him, but when the night is over
He is gone,
the river's just a river
Without him, the world around me changes
The trees are bare and everywhere
The streets are full of strangers
I love him, but every day I'm learning
All my life, I've only been pretending
Without me, his world would go on turning
A world that's full of happiness
That I have never known
I love him...
I love him...
I love him...
But only on my ownWait a minute, bring it back
Wait a minute, bring it back
Wait a minute, bring it back

When their voices were soft
And their words inviting
There was a time when love was blind
And the world was a song
And the song was exciting
There was a time
Then it all went wrong
I dreamed
a dream in time gone by
When hope was high and life worth living
I dreamed that love would never die
I dreamed that God would be forgiving
Then I was young and unafraid
And dreams were made and used and wasted
There was no ransom to be paid
No song unsung, no wine untasted
But the tigers come at night
With their voices soft as thunder
As they tear your hope apart
As they turn your dream to shame
He slept a summer by my side
He filled my days with endless wonder
He took my childhood in his stride
But he was gone when autumn came
And still I dream he'll come to me
That we will live the years together
But there are dreams that cannot be
And there are storms we cannot weather
I had a dream my life would be
So different from this hell I'm living
So different now from what it seemed
Now life has killed the dream I dreamedClub, Legend, Art, Theater

"M'sieur le maire," you'll wear a different chain
Before you say another word, Javert
Before you chain me up like a slave again
Listen to me!
There is something I must do
This woman leaves behind a suffering child
There is none but me who can intercede
In mercy's name, three days are all I need
Then I'll return, I pledge my word
Then I'll return—
You must think me mad
I've hunted you across the years
Men like you can never change
A man, such as you
Believe of me
What you will
There is a duty that I'm sworn to do
You know nothing of my life
All I did was steal some bread
Men like me can never change
Men like you can never change
No!
24601...
You know nothing of the world
You would sooner see me dead
But not before I see this justice done
My duty's to the law
You have no rights
Come with me, 24601
Now the wheel has turned around
Jean Valjean is nothing now
I am warning you, Javert
I'm a stronger man by far
There is power in me yet
My race is not yet run
!
Dare you talk to me of crime
And the price you had to pay
Every man is born in sin
Every man must choose his way
I am warning you, Javert
There is nothing I won't dare
If I have to
kill
you here
I'll do what must be done!
You know nothing of Javert
I was born inside a jail
I was born with scum like you
I am from the gutter, too
[
Valjean breaks a chair and threatens Javert with the broken piece.
He turns to Fantine.]
And this I swear to you tonight
Your child will live within my care
And I will raise her to the light
There is no place for you to hide
Wherever you may hide away
I swear to you, I will be there
[They fight. Javert is knocked out.
Valjean escapes.]He got older but never grew
For his life he can't tell the truth
How to love he ain't got a clue
Playing games like he'll never lose you
Try to talk to him can't get through
Every day he's a different dude
These are the signs of a grown ass boy
Better run for the hills I'm just trying to keep it real
You can't raise a man
He's already grown what you gonna do, you wonder why he
Acts like a boy
It's cause he wasn't raised right before you
Girl, you ain't never gonna change nobody
If he don't wanna, you can't make nobody
Cause you can't raise a man
Coming home any time at night
Expecting you to let it ride
How many tears are you gonna cry?
Playing games like he'll never lose you
You know that the love is changed
How many times he called you out your name?
These are the signs of a grown ass boy
Better run for the hills I'm just keeping it real
You can't raise a man
He's already grown what you gonna do, you wonder why he
Acts like a boy
It's cause he wasn't raised right before you
Girl, you ain't never gonna change nobody
If he don't wanna, you can't make nobody
Cause you can't raise a man
Gonna take more than a miracle
To change him just let him go
Tell me when will you decide
To do better with your life?
If his momma couldn't do it, what makes you think
You can train a boy to be a man? It's too late
Better off letting him go
No matter how hard you try, you can't raise
You can't raise a man
He's already grown what you gonna do, you wonder why he
Acts like a boy
It's cause he wasn't raised right before you
Girl, you ain't never gonna change nobody
If he don't wanna, you can't make nobody
Cause you can't raise a manYeah, Yeah
Nobody is off limits
Not even your friends
I'm 'bout to go in, 'bout to go in, 'bout to go in...
I'ma do something I never do
I'ma try & hurt you too
Feels so damn good to be cold
& I don't even care if you know
Imma let him kiss my body, touch my body
Record it and make sure you find it
How you gonna trip
Boy you been with everybody

It's easy to do the shit that you do
I can just switch it up on you

Another day, another destiny
This never ending road to Calvary
These men who seem to know my crime
Will surely come a second time
One day more
I did not live until today
How can I live when we are parted?
One day more
Tomorrow you'll be worlds away
And yet with you, my world has started
One more day all on my own
Will we ever meet again?
One more day with him not caring
I was born to be with you
What a life I might have known
And I swear I will be true!
But he never saw me there
One more day before the storm
At the barricades of Freedom
When our ranks begin to form
Will you take your place with me?
Do I follow where she goes?
Shall I join my brothers there?
Do I stay or do I dare?
The time is now
The day is here
One day more!
One more day till revolution
We will nip it in the bud
We'll be ready for these schoolboys
They will wet themselves with blood!
One day more!
Watch them run amuck
Catch'm as they fall
Never know your luck
When there's a free for all
Here a little dip
There a little touch
Most of them are goners
So they won't miss much!
One day to a new beginning
Raise the flag of freedom high!
Every man will be a king
Every man will be a king
There's a new world for the winning
There's a new world to be won
Do you hear the people sing?
My place is here
I fight with you!
One day more!
I did not live until today
Tomorrow you'll be worlds away
And yet with you my world has started
One more day all on my own
I will join these people's heroes
I will follow where they go
I will know their little secrets
I will know the things they know
One day more!
Watch 'em run amuck
Catch 'em as they fall
Never know your luck
When there's a free-for-all
One more day to revolution
We will nip it in the bud
We'll be ready for these schoolboys
Tomorrow is the judgement day
Tomorrow we'll be far away
Tomorrow is the judgement day
Tomorrow we'll discover
What our God in Heaven has in store!
One more dawn
One more day
One day more!Heart beats, but I don't feel
I touch, but it ain't real
They say I move too fast
Going man to man
Always holding a new hand
Why can't they understand
Sex is irrelevant
Just a game in my head, I'm playing and I'm winning
 I broke another heart today
 and I didn't care until I walked away
Cause they think I love 'em
But I love 'em all, love 'em all ye-yeah
I need another one to get over the other one
Another one, ye-yeah
Cause they think I love 'em
But I love 'em all, love 'em all ye-yeah
I need another one to get over the other one
Another one, ye-yeah
They all wait for my call
They all want me to fall
All these men, they're a mess
Want me like the rest
I'm continuing not giving my best
Why can't they understand
Sex is irrelevant
Just a game in my head, I'm playing and I'm winning
 I broke another heart today
 and I didn't care until I walked away
Cause they think I love 'em
But I love 'em all, love 'em all ye-yeah
I need another one to get over the other one
Another one, ye-yeah
Cause they think I love 'em
But I love 'em all, love 'em all ye-yeah
I need another one to get over the other one
Another one, ye-yeah
Maybe one day I’ll settle down
But for now
I’ll just play around
And I’ll make em all feel good
That’s how I get ‘em
Making all feel special
Then I forget them
So I won’t hurt
I keep a lot of them
And I love 'em all
Cause they think I love 'em
But I love 'em all, love 'em all ye-yeah
I need another one to get over the other one
Another one, ye-yeah
Cause they think I love 'em
But I love 'em all, love 'em all ye-yeah

She's having the child I should've carried
I'll be damned if yall get married
How's the baby, How you adjusting?
Ain't gon work, you got problems trusting
Let me stop, I'm supposed to be focused
But these nights are the coldest
Will you ever let her go? I don't know
Will I ever be first? I hope
But I ain't just sitting around, can't wait for someone to see my worth
Damn I can't compete with a baby
Is there any room left in your heart for me
I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him
Maybe I should call, Maybe I should call
I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him
But I never call
Maybe that's my flaw
Maybe that's why I ain't got a man
Cause I be doing too much thinking
Tryna compensate for your absence
But no drug can take me where you can
No I just want you where I am
1,000 of them, just want one him
Drowning in all of my excuses
Heart is feeling useless
Probably should've used it less
Will you ever let her go? I don't know
Will I ever be first? I hope
But I ain't just sitting around, can't wait for someone to see my worth
Damn I can't compete with a baby
Is there any room left in your heart for me
I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him
Maybe I should call, Maybe I should call
I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him
But I never call
Maybe that's my flaw
After the last time we talked
Oh, I was a mess
You had me stressed
Oh no no no no no
I wrote the text, I didn't send it
Dialed your number, but said forget it
Oh, what would it change
She's still in the way
But I
I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him
Maybe I should call, Maybe I should call
I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him
But I never call
Maybe that's my flawCome on you old pest
Fetch a bottle of your best

Or I'm not Thenardier
Gissa glass a' rum
Landlord, over here!

Right away, you scum
Right away, m'sieur
God this place has gone to hell
So you tell me every year
Mine host Thenardier
He was there so they say
At the field of Waterloo
Got there, it's true
When the fight was all through
But he knew just what to do
Crawling through the mud, so I've heard it said
Picking through the pockets of the English dead
He made a tidy score
From the spoils of war
My band of soaks
My den of dissolutes
My dirty jokes
My always pissed-as-newts
My sons of whores
Spend their lives in my inn
Homing pigeons homing in
They fly through my doors
And their money's good as yours
Ain't got a clue
What he put in this stew
Must have scraped it off the street
God, what a wine!
Chateau Neuf de Turpentine
Must have pressed it with his feet
Landlord, over here
Where's the bloody man
One more for the road
One more slug o' gin
Just one more
Or my old man is gonna do me in
]
Welcome, Monsieur, sit yourself down
And meet the best innkeeper in town
As for the rest, all of 'em crooks
Rooking their guests and
cooking the books
Seldom do you see
Honest men like me
A gent of good intent
Who's content to be
Master of the house, doling out the charm
Ready with a handshake and an open palm
Tells a saucy tale, makes a little stir
Customers appreciate a bon-viveur
Glad to do a friend a favor, doesn't cost me to be nice
But nothing gets you nothing,
everything has got a little price!
Master of the house, keeper of the zoo
Ready to relieve 'em of a sou or two
Watering the wine, making up the weight
Pickin' up their knick-knacks when they can't see straight
Everybody loves a landlord
Everybody's bosom friend
I do whatever pleases
Jesus!
Won't I bleed 'em in the end!
Master of the house, quick to catch your eye
Never wants a passerby to pass him by
Servant to the poor, butler to the great
Comforter, philosopher, and lifelong mate!
Everybody's boon companion
Everybody's chaperone
But lock up your valises
Jesus! Won't I skin you to the bone!
Enter Monsieur, lay down your load
Unlace your boots, rest from the road
This weighs a ton, travel's a curse
But here we strive to lighten your purse
Here the goose is cooked
Here the fat is fried
And nothing's overlooked
Till I'm satisfied
Food beyond compare, food
beyond belief
Mix it in a mincer and pretend it's beef
Kidney of a horse, liver of a cat
Filling up the sausages with this and that
Residents are more than welcome,
bridal suite is occupied
Reasonable charges plus some little extras on the side
Charge 'em for the lice, extra for the mice
Two percent for looking in the mirror twice
Here a little slice, there a little cut
Three percent for sleeping with the window shut
When it comes to fixing prices
There are a lot of tricks he knows
How it all increases
All those bits and pieces
Jesus, It's amazing how it grows
Master of the house, quick to catch your eye
Never wants a passerby to pass him by
Servant to the poor butler to the great
Comforter, philosopher, and lifelong mate
Everybody's boon companion
Gives 'em everything he's got
Dirty bunch of geezers
Jesus, what a sorry little lot
I used to dream that I would meet a prince
But God Almighty, have you seen what's happened since?
Master of the house? Isn't worth me spit!
'Comforter, philosopher,' and lifelong shit
Cunning little brain,
regular Voltaire
Thinks he's quite a lover,
but there's not much there
What a cruel trick of nature
Landed me with such a louse
God knows how I've lasted
Living with this bastard in the house
Master of the house
Master and a half
Comforter, philosopher
Don't make me laugh
Servant to the poor, butler to the great
Hypocrite and toady and inebriate
Everybody bless the landlord
Everybody bless his spouse
Everybody raise a glass
Raise it up the master's ass
Everybody raise a glass to the master of the houseFront step, cha-cha-cha
Back step, cha-cha-cha
Side step, front step
Back, and turn
Oh my God, Penny, there's Link
Link!
I can't believe I'm really here auditioning!
I can't believe I'm really here watching you audition!
Front step, cha-cha-cha
Back step, cha-cha-cha
Side step, front step
Back, and tu-
Oh, Amber, look at this
motley crew
!
Oh, this town sure has gone downhill since crowned Miss-
Oh Mother, not more ancient history!
Oh, my God, how times have changed!
These girls must be blind or completely deranged
But time seemed to halt
When I was Miss Baltimore
Crabs
Amber!
That move is far too dirty!
Mother, wake up from that dream of yours, this isn't 1930
You can laugh, but life's a test
Don't do this, don't do that!
Remember
Mother knows best
For the crown's in the vault
From when I won Miss Baltimore
Crabs
These steps are perfect ammunition
Let me show you how your Mommy dear took out the competition
Girls, go get 'em
Boys, let's rumba
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven
Those poor runner-ups might still hold some grudges
They padded their cups, but I screwed the judges
Those broads thought they'd win
If a
plate they would spin in their dance
Ha! Not a chance!
Boys, put me down
Oh, good morning ladies
Let's see what you got
Twist, twist, twist, twist
Mashed potato, mambo
Ready?
Begin
On my show, you'll never find
A thrusting hip or bumping grind
What's that?
A dance for fleas and ticks?
Oh, you should have seen my bag of tricks!
Oh, I hit the stage, batons ablaze!
While
belting Aida
and
preparing souffles!
But that triple somersault
Is how I clinched Miss Baltimore
Crabs!
Proceed
Are you scared we're on live?
No, I'm sure I can cope
Well, this show isn't broadcast in-
Cinemascope!
I never drank one chocolate malt-
No desserts for Miss Baltimore
Crabs
This one will never get a date in those hand-me-down clothes
Ha! Kid, she'll never get a date 'til Daddy buys her a new nose
I would say, "Oy, gevalt!"
If I wasn't Miss Baltimore Crabs
Do you dance like you dress?
Amber, there's no need to be cruel
Would you swim in an integrated pool?
I sure would! I'm all for integration. It's the new frontier!
Not in Baltimore, it isn't
And may I be frank?
First impressions can be tough and when I saw you, I knew it
If your size weren't enough,
your last answer just blew it
And so, my dear, so short and stout
You'll never be in, so we're kicking you out!
With your form and your face, oh, but it isn't your fault
You're just down with a case of Miss
Baltimore Crabs!
Eh, you may go
Um, thank you?
I think they secretly liked you!
May I please audition?
Ha ha ha, of course not!
But you may bow and
exalt
Cause I am Miss Baltimore
Crabs!
Crabs, crabs, crabs!You took my love and I'm willing
But there's no limit to the love I'm giving
The love I'm giving, Ooooooooo..
There's no reason why
We should be apart
Ooh, Oh Baby
Cause searching for something out there
Will leave two lonely hearts
Two lonely hearts
Baby don't you know?
We've come to far to let it all end
I've told you over and over again
How I feel inside but if you go
Oooh baby, there's something you should know
Something you should know
There's something in my heart
Something in my heart, something in my heart
Ooh it's got me hooked on you
Baby if we try
Things will get better
No one can tell me different
We should be together
Baby don't you know?
The changes I'm going through
You know I'll never be the same
Your love has touched me so
There's no one else to blame
But you...
We've come too far to let it all end
I've told you over and over again
How I feel inside but if you go
Ooh baby there's something you should know
Something you should know
There's something you should know
There's something in my heart
Something in my heart, something in my heart
Ooh it's got me hooked on you]
There is a castle on a cloud
I like to go there in my sleep
Aren't any floors for me to sweep
Not in my castle on a cloud
There is a room that's full of toys
There are a hundred boys and girls
Nobody shouts or talks too loud
Not in my castle on a cloud
There is a lady all in white
Holds me and sings a lullaby
She's nice to see and she's soft to touch
She says, "Cosette, I love you very much"
I know a place where no one's lost
I know a place where no one cries
Crying at all is not allowed
Not in my castle on a cloud
Oh, help! I think I hear them now
And I'm nowhere near finished sweeping
And scrubbing and polishing the floors
Oh, it's her!
It's Madame!
]
Now look who's here, the little madame herself
Pretending once again she's been so awfully good
Better not let me catch you slacking
Better not catch my eye
Ten rotten francs your mother sends me
What is that going to buy?
Now, take that pail, my little "Mademoiselle"
And go and draw some water from the well
We should never had taken you in, in the first place
How stupid the things that we do
Like mother, like daughter, the scum of the street
Eponine, come my dear, Eponine, let me see you
You look very well in that little blue hat
There's some little girls who know how to behave
And they know what to wear
And I'm saying thank heaven for that
Still there, Cosette? Your tears will do you no good
I told you fetch some water from the well in the wood
Please do not send me out alone
Not in the darkness on my own
Enough of that,
or I'll forget to be nice
You heard me ask for something
and I never ask twiceLadies & gentlemen 
Introducing K. Michelle
Tonight I'm feeling sexy 
I can make you overdose, make it overflow, if you let me 
Like a river, my waterfalls'll breakdown a levee
You gon' get soaked, so bring a raincoat
When we finish you gon' see a rainbow
Come swim in my waters like a sailboat
You just may get lost in me like Nemo
Come sip on it, as I drip on it
You gon' have to change my name to H2O
You love it when I call your name
Daddy, daddy
You love it when I make it rain
Daddy, daddy
Storms will come
Make me overflow 
Can you stand the rain?
When we get done
I still want some more 
Can you make it rain?
I can get it wetter than a thunderstorm 
Make love from the midnight 'til the early morn 
Wakin' you up like some Folgers in your cup
That morning brew, that's what I do 
Baby, can you swim deep? 
Diving in the ocean while you in the sheets 
What stroke do you got for me?
You know I'm trying to drown you, oh
You love it when I call your name
Daddy, daddy
You love it when I make it rain
Daddy, daddy
Storms will come
Make me overflow 
Can you stand the rain? 
When we get done 
I still want some more 
Can you make it rain? 
Every time you pull up, boy, it's a tidal wave
Ooh, she get wet up, we drip the night away
Boy, it ain't no rush, take your time with me
Boy, I love when you keep it right there, no, don't ever ever stop
I'm gon' ride, baby, it's you and I
Through the good and bad, I'ma be your ride or die
And when the storm comes, and the rain falls
We'll be making up, we'll be making love
Storms will come
Make me overflow 
Can you stand the rain? 
When we get done 
I still want some more 
Can you make it rain? At the end of the day you're another day older
And that's all you can say for the life of the poor
It's a struggle, it's a war
And there's nothing that anyone's giving
One more day, standing about, what is it for?
One day less to be living
At the end of the day you're another day colder
And the shirt on your back doesn't keep out the chill
And the righteous hurry past
They don't hear the little ones crying
And the winter is coming on fast, ready to kill
One day nearer to dying
]
At the end of the day there's another day dawning
And the sun in the morning is waiting to rise
Like the waves crash on the sand
Like a storm that'll break any second
There's a hunger in the land
There's a reckoning still to be reckoned
And there's gonna be hell to pay
At the end of the day
At the end of the day you get nothing for nothing
Sitting flat on your butt doesn't buy any bread
There are children back at home
And the children have got to be fed
And you're lucky to be in a job
And in a bed
And we're counting our blessings!
Have you seen how the foreman is fuming today?
With his terrible breath and his wandering hands?
It's because little Fantine won't give him his way
Take a look at his trousers, you'll see where he stands!
]
At the end of the day it's another day over
With enough in your pocket to last for a week
Pay the landlord, pay the shop
Keep on grafting as long as you're able
Keep on grafting till you drop
Or it's back to the crumbs on the table
You've got to pay your way
At the end of the day!
Now what have we here, little innocent sister?
Come on Fantine, let's have all the news!
"Dear Fantine, you must send us more money
Your child needs a doctor
There's no time to lose"
What is this fighting all about?
Will someone tear these two apart?
What is this fighting all about?
This is a factory, not a circus
Now come on ladies, settle down
I run a business of repute
I am the Mayor of this town
I'll look to you to sort this out
And be as patient as you can
Now someone say how this began
At the end of the day she's the one who began it
There's a kid that she's hiding in some little town
There's a man she has to pay
You can guess how she picks up the extra
You can bet she's earning her keep sleeping around
And the boss wouldn't like it
Yes, it's true there's a child and the child is my daughter
And her father abandoned us, leaving us flat
Now she lives with an innkeeper, man and his wife
And I pay for the child
What's the matter with that?
]
At the end of the day she'll be nothing but trouble
And there's trouble for all when there's trouble for one
While we're earning our daily bread
She's the one with her hands in the butter
You must send the slut away
Or we're all gonna end in the gutter
And it's us who'll have to pay
At the end of the day
I might have known the bitch could bite
I might have known the cat had claws
I might have guessed your little secret
Ah, yes, the virtuous Fantine
Who keeps herself so pure and clean
You'd be the cause I had no doubt
Of any trouble hereabout
You play a virgin in the light
But need no urgin' in the night
She's been laughing at you
While she's having her men
She'll be nothing but trouble again and again
You must sack her today
Sack the girl today
Right, my girl. On your way!You got the right one
You got the right one
I just really hate you
All that game you've been running
Now it's time that I played you
And why I let you do me
Like doors wide open you ran right through me
But you done found the right one nigga
Fuck you and all that
Blast on Twitter then I'm a blast back
You want a ratchet then I'm a be that
Don't make me call my boys and have yo shit peeled back
Oh, boy you really don't know how you making me feel
You make me wanna kill a man
Oh you really gon make me show you how I feel
You got the right one, nigga
Damn, I really hate you
I'm a say it again cause the truth is I made you
Now you out here fronting
When you was just begging me
In the rain
Down on your knees trying to explain
See you know, I know the truth but still you wanna go there?
You got the right one, nigga
Fuck you and all that
Blast on Twitter then I'm a blast back
You want a ratchet then I'm a be that

Every since I left you been calling my phone
You ain't never gon find another chick like me
You ain't never gon find another chick like me, no

Blast on Twitter then I'm a blast back
You want a ratchet then I'm a be that
Don't make me call my boys and have yo shit peeled back

Students, workers, everyone
There's a river on the run
Like the flowing of the tide
Paris coming to our side!
The time is near
So near, it's stirring the blood in their veins
And yet beware
Don't let the wine go to your brains
For the army we fight is a dangerous foe
With the men and the arms that we never can match
Oh, it's easy to sit here and swat 'em like flies
But the national guard will be harder to catch
We need a sign
To rally the people
To call them to arms
To bring them in line!

Some wine and say what's going on
A ghost you say, a ghost maybe
She was just like a ghost to me
One minute there, and she was gone
I am agog
I am aghast
Is Marius in love at last
I have never seen him 'ooh' and 'aah'
You talk of battles to be won
But here he comes like Don Ju-an
It's better than an o-per-a!
It is time for us all
To decide who we are
Do we fight for the right
To a night at the opera now?
Have you asked of yourselves
What's the price you might pay?
Is it simply a game
For rich young boys to play?
The color of the world
Is changing day by day
Red - the blood of angry men
Black - the dark of ages past
Red - a world about to dawn
Black - the night that ends at last
Had you been there tonight
You might know how it feels
To be struck to the bone
In a moment of breathless delight
Had you been there tonight
You might also have known
How the world may be changed
In just one burst of light
And what was right
Seems wrong
And what was wrong
Seems right
Red
I feel my soul on fire
Black
My world if she's not there
Red
The color of desire
Black
The color of despair
Marius, you're no longer a child
I do not doubt you mean it well
But now there is a higher call
Who cares about your lonely soul
We strive toward a larger goal
Our little lives don't count at all
Red - the blood of angry men
Black - the dark of ages past
Red - a world about to dawn
Black - the night that ends at last

It's a rallying cry that will reach every ear
In the death of LaMarque we will kindle the flame
They will see that the day of salvation is near
The time is here
Let us welcome it gladly with courage and cheer
Let us take to the streets with no doubt in our hearts
But a jubilant shout
They will come one and all
They will come when we callA heart full of love
A heart full of song
I'm doing everything all wrong
Oh God, for shame
I do not even know your name
Dear Mad'moiselle
Won't you say?
Will you tell?
A heart full of love
No fear, no regret
My name is Marius Pontmercy
And mine's Cosette
Cosette, I don't know what to say!
Then make no sound!
I am lost
I am found
A heart full of light
A night bright as day
And you must never go away
Cosette, Cosette!
This is a chain we'll never break
Do I dream?
I'm awake
A heart full of love
He was never mine to lose
A heart full of you
Why regret what could not be?
A single look and then I knew
These are words he'll never say
Not to me
Not to me
Not to me
I knew it too
From today
Every day
 
And it isn't a dream 
Not a dream 
After all! There, out in the darkness
A fugitive running
Fallen from God, fallen from grace
God be my witness
I never shall yield
Till we come face to face
Till we come face to face
He knows his way in the dark
But mine is the way of the Lord
Those who follow the path of the righteous
Shall have their reward
And if they fall as Lucifer fell
The flame, the sword
Stars, in your multitudes
Scarce to be counted
Filling the darkness with order and light
You are the sentinels
Silent and sure
Keeping watch in the night
Keeping watch in the night
You know your place in the sky
You hold your course and your aim
And each in your season returns and returns
And is always the same
And if you fall as Lucifer fell
You fall in flame
And so it must be
For so it is written
On the doorway to paradise
That those who falter and those who fall
Must pay the price
Lord let me find him
That I may see him
Safe behind bars
I will never rest
Till then, this I swear
This I swear by the stars!
That inspector thinks he's something
But it's me that runs this town
And my theater never closes
And the curtain's never down
Trust Gavroche, have no fear
Don't you worry, auntie dear
You can always find me hereIf you really wanna know
What I want in a guy
Well I'm looking for a dream on a mean machine
With hell in his eyes
I want a devil in skin tight leather
He's gotta be wild as the wind
And one fine night
I'll be holdin on tight, to
A cool rider
A cool rider
If he's cool enough
He can burn me through and through
Woah
If it takes forever
Then I'll wait forever
No ordinary boy
No ordinary boy is gonna do
I want a rider that's cool
That's the way it's gonna be
And that's the way that I feel
I want a whole lot more than the boy next door
I want hell on wheels
Just give me a black motorcycle
With a man rollin' out of the seat
So move aside
'Cause I'm gonna ride
With
A cool rider
A cool rider
If he's cool enough
He can burn me through and through
Woah
If it takes forever
Then I'll wait forever
No ordinary boy
No ordinary boy is gonna do
I want a rider that's cool
I don't want no ordinary guys
Coming on strong with me
They don't know what I'm looking for
They don't know what I need
They're gonna know when he gets in
'Cause the ground will be shakin'
I'll do anything to let him know that I'm his
His for the takin'

Alone, I wait in the shadows
I count the hours till I can sleep
I dreamed a dream
Cosette stood by
It made her weep to know I die
Alone at the end of the day
Upon this wedding night, I pray
Take these children, my Lord, to thy embrace
And show them grace
God on high, hear my prayer
Take me now to thy care
Where You are, let me be
Take me now, take me there
Bring me home
Bring me home
[
Fantine's spirit appears to Valjean.
]
Monsieur, I bless your name
Monsieur, lay down your burden
You raised my child in love
I am ready, Fantine
At the end of my days
She's the best of my life
And you will be with God
[
Marius and Cosette rush into the room.
They do not see Fantine.]
Papa, Papa, I do not understand!
Are you alright? They said you'd gone away
Cosette, my child, am I forgiven now?
Thank God, thank God, I've lived to see this day
It's you who must forgive a thoughtless fool
It's you who must forgive a thankless man
It's thanks to you that I am living
And again I lay down my life at your feet
Cosette, your father is a saint
When they wounded me
He took me from the barricade
Carried like a babe
And brought me home to you!
Now you are here
Again, beside me
Now, I can die in peace
For now my life is blessed
You will live!
Papa, you're going to live!
It's too soon
Too soon to say goodbye
Yes, Cosette
Forbid me now to die
I'll obey... I will try...
On this page
I write my last confession
Read it well
When I, at last, am sleeping
It's the story
Of those who always loved you
:
Your mother gave her life for you
And gave you to my keeping
]
Come with me
Where chains will never bind you
All your grief
At last, at last, behind you
Lord in Heaven
Look down on him in mercy
Forgive me all my trespasses
And take me to Your glory
Take my hand
And lead me to salvation
Take my love
For love is everlasting
And remember
The truth that once was spoken:
To love another person is to see the face of God!

Do you hear the people sing?
Lost in the valley of the night
It is the music of a people
Who are climbing to the light
For the wretched of the Earth
There is a flame that never dies
Even the darkest night will end
And the sun will rise
They will live again in freedom
In the garden of the Lord
They will walk behind the ploughshare
They will put away the sword
The chain will be broken
And all men will have their reward
Who will join in our crusade?
Who will be strong and stand with me?
Somewhere beyond the barricade
Is there a world you long to see?
Do you hear the people sing?
Say, do you hear the distant drums?
It is the future that they bring
When tomorrow comes!

Aah, aah, aah
Tomorrow comes!I smell women, smell 'em in the air
Think I'll drop my anchor in that harbor over there

Seven days at sea can make you hungry for a poke
Even stokers need a little stoke!

Lovely ladies, waiting for a bite
Waiting for the
customers who only come at night
Lovely ladies, waiting for the call
Standing up or lying down or any way at all
Bargain prices up against the wall

Come here, my dear, let's see this trinket you wear
This bagatelle
Madame, I'll sell it to you
I'll give you four
That wouldn't pay for the chain
I'll give you five.
You're far too eager to sell
It's up to you...
It's all I have
That's not my fault
Please make it ten
No more than five
My dear, we all must stay alive
Lovely ladies, waiting in the dark
Ready for a thick one or a quick one in the park
Long time, short time, any time, my dear
Cost a little extra if you want to take all year!
Quick and cheap is underneath the pier!

What pretty hair, what pretty locks you got there
What luck you got, it's worth a centime my dear
I'll take the lot
Don't touch me! Leave me alone
Let's make a price, I'll give you all of ten francs
Just think of that
It pays a debt
Just think of that
What can I do? It pays a debt
Ten francs may save my poor Cosette
Lovely lady
Lovely ladies
Fastest on the street
Lovely little girls
Wasn't there three minutes
Lovely ladies
She was back up on her feet
Lovely little ladies
Lovely lady
Lovely girlies
What you waiting for
Lovely little girls
Doesn't take a lot of savvy
We are lovely
Just to be a whore
Lovely girls
Come on, lady
Lovely ladies
What's a lady for
What's a lady for
Give me the dirt, who's that bit over there
A bit of skirt, she's the one sold her hair
She's got a kid, sends her all that she can
I might have known,
there is always some man
Lovely lady, come along and join us
Lovely lady
Come on dearie, why all the fuss
You're no grander than the rest of us
Life has dropped you at the bottom of the heap
Join your sisters—
—Make money in your sleep
That's right, dearie, let him have the lot
That's right, dearie, show him what you've got
Old men, young men, take 'em as they come
Harbor rats and alley cats and every type of scum
Poor men, rich men, leaders of the land
See them with their trousers off, they're never quite as grand
All it takes is money in your hand
Lovely ladies, going for a song
Got a lot of callers, but they never stay for long
Come on, Captain, you can wear your shoes
Don't it make a change to have a girl who can't refuse?
Easy money, lying on a bed
Just as well they never see the hate that's in your head
Don't they know they're making love to one already dead?There's a grief that can't be spoken
There's a pain goes on and on
Empty chairs at empty tables
Now my friends are dead and gone
Here they talked of revolution
Here it was they lit the flame
Here they sang about 'tomorrow'
And tomorrow never came
From the table in the corner
They could see a world reborn
And they rose with voices ringing
And I can hear them now!
The very words that they had sung
Became their last communion
On the lonely barricade at dawn
Oh my friends, my friends forgive me
That I live and you are gone
There's a grief that can't be spoken
There's a pain goes on and on
Phantom faces at the window
Phantom shadows on the floor
Empty chairs at empty tables
Where my friends will meet no more
Oh my friends, my friends, don't ask me
What your sacrifice was for
Empty chairs at empty tables
Where my friends will sing no moreLook down and see the beggars at your feet
Look down and show some mercy if you can
Look down and see the sweepings of the street
Look down, look down, upon your fellow man
]
How do you do? My name's Gavroche
These are my people, here's my patch
Not much to look at, nothing posh
Nothing that you'd call up to scratch
This is my school, my high society
Here in the slums of Saint Michel
We live on crumbs of humble piety
Tough on the teeth, but what the hell
Think you're poor, think you're free
Follow me, follow me!
Look down, and show some mercy if you can
Look down, look down upon your fellow man
What you think you're at
Hanging round me pitch
If you're new around here, girl
You've got a lot to learn
Listen you old bat
Crazy bloody witch
'Least I give my customers
Some pleasure in return
I know what you give
Give 'em all the pox
Spread around your poison
Till they end up in a box
Leave the poor old cow
Move it, Madeleine
She used to be no better
Till the clap got to her brain
When's it gonna end
When we gonna live
Something's gotta happen now or
Something's gonna give
It'll come, it'll come, it'll come
It'll come, it'll come, it'll come

Where are the leaders of the land?
Where are the
swells
who run this show?
Only one man and that's LaMarque
Speaks for the people here below
See our children fed
Help us in our shame
Something for a crust of bread
In Holy Jesus' name
In the Lord's Holy name
In his name, in his name, in his name
LaMarque is ill and fading fast
Won't last the week out so they say
With all the anger in the land
How long before the judgement day
Before we cut the fat ones down to size
Before the barricades arise
Watch out for old Thénardier
All of his family is on the make
Once ran a hash-house down the way
Bit of a swine and no mistake
He's got a gang, the bleeding layabout
Even his daughter does her share
That's Éponine, she knows her way about
Only a kid, but hard to scare
Do we care? Not a cuss
Long live us, long live us!
Look down and show
Some mercy if you can
Look down, look down
Upon your fellow manWe konden over alles praten, alles
Maar alles ging over de liefde, we vergaten alles
In een brief, een smsje, in een liedje schreef ik
Ik zal alles voor je doen en voor je liefde leef ik
En die liefde kreeg ik, en vaak in overmate
Je kon de drempels van het leven aan me overlaten
Je zag die meiden haten want ik had m’n superheld
Je had je vrienden net te vaak over mij verteld
Nu staren we samen naar de tafel met de mondjes dicht
Blikken die vanzelf spreken in ons gezicht
Ik heb het overgrote deel van alles aangericht
Maar ik rijd te lang in deze tunnel en ik zie geen licht
Dus doe je ogen dicht voor onze laatste set
En denk terug aan het kleine huisje met het kleine bed
Shit... maar morgen is de pijn terug
Staan we uren op de halte rijdt de trein terug
Het duurt te lang
We staan hier al een tijdje
En we moeten door dus voor de laatste keer het spijt me
Het duurt te lang
Het duurt te lang
We staan stil
Wat jij wil, wat ik wil
Het duurt te lang
Twee stille mensen aan de tafel het is geen gezicht
Ik kan die route niet belopen met m'n ogen dicht
Je weet precies wat ik ga zeggen, ‘k weet het ook van jou
En op het eind vertel ik vast hoeveel ik van je hou
En daarna slaan de deuren weer en breekt er weer een glas
Daarna valt er weer een traan en pak ik weer m’n tas
En.. daarna hou ik je weer stevig vast
En leg m'n kleren weer terug in de kast
Dus ik hou je nog een poosje vast want dan vergeet je nog hoe boos je was
Maar de pijn blijft zitten dus het helpt niet
Dus waarschijnlijk is het morgen weer hetzelfde lied
De tekst komt op hetzelfde neer in dezelfde beat
Een soort van gouden verf op een blok verdriet
Conflicten zijn normaal maar het moet ons niet verstikken
M'n tranen vallen niet dus ik laat het liedje snikken
Het duurt te lang
We staan hier al een tijdje
En we moeten door dus voor de laatste keer het spijt me
Het duurt te lang
Het duurt te lang
Het duurt te langI'm bluer than the ocean
I'm golden like the rising sun and
I'm red with hot emotion, hmm-hmm, hmm
And when they try to hold me down
Inside a box, I'll find my way out
I'm keeping it in motion, hmm-hmm, hmm
When life brings me trouble, this I know
I never walk away, na-na
Walk away, na-na

There's a boy climbing the barricade!
Good God! What are you doing?
'Ponine, have you no fear?
Have you seen my beloved?
Why have you come back here?
Took the letter like you said
I met her father at the door
He said he would give it
I don't think I can stand anymore
Éponine, what's wrong?
I feel there's something wet upon your hair
Éponine, you're hurt! You need some help
Oh, God! It's everywhere!
Don't you fret, M'sieur Marius. I don't feel any pain
A little fall of rain, can hardly hurt me now
You're here. That's all I need to know
And you will keep me safe
And you will keep me close
And rain will make the flowers grow
But you will live, 'Ponine, dear God above
If I could heal your wounds with words of love
Just hold me now, and let it be
Shelter me, comfort me
You would live a hundred years, if I could show you how
I won't desert you now...
The rain can't hurt me now
This rain will wash away what's past
And you will keep me safe
And you will keep me close
I’ll sleep in your embrace at last
The rain that brings you here is heaven blessed
The skies begin to clear, and I'm at rest
A breath away from where you are
I've come home from so far
Hush-a-bye, dear Éponine
You won't feel any pain
A little fall of rain
Can hardly hurt you now
So don't you fret, M'sieur Marius
I don't feel any pain
A little fall of rain
Can hardly hurt me now
I'm here
That's all I need to know
And you will keep me safe
And you will keep me close
And rain...
Will make the flowers...
I'll stay with you
'Till you are sleeping
And rain
Will make the flowers

Don't look 'em in the eye
Look down, look down
You're here until you die
The sun is strong
It's hot as Hell below
Look down, look down
There's twenty years to go
I've done no wrong
Sweet Jesus, hear my prayer
Look down, look down
Sweet Jesus doesn't care
I know she'll wait
I know that she'll be true
Look down, look down
They've all forgotten you
When I get free you won't see me
Here for dust
Look down, look down
Don't look 'em in the eye
How long, oh Lord
Before you let me die?
Look down, look down
You'll always be a slave
Look down, look down
You're standing in your grave
Now bring me Prisoner 24601
Your time is up
And your parole's begun
You know what that means
Yes, it means I'm free
No!
It means you get your yellow ticket-of-leave
You are a thief
I stole a loaf of bread
You robbed a house!
I broke a window pane
My sister's child was close to death
And we were starving
You will starve again
Unless you learn the meaning of the law
I know the meaning of those nineteen years
A slave of the law
Five years for what you did
The rest because you tried to run
Yes, 24601
My name is Jean Valjean!
And I'm Javert
Do not forget my name
Do not forget me, 24601
Look down, look down

Aaah, aah, aaaahhhh
Freedom is mine
The earth is still
I feel the wind
I breathe again
And the skies clear
The world is waking
Drink from the pool
How clean the taste
Never forget the years, the waste
Nor forgive them
For what they've done
They are the guilty, everyone
The day begins
And now let's see
What this new world
Will do for me
You'll have to go
I'll pay you off for the day
Collect your bits and pieces there
And be on your way
You have given me half
What the other men get
This handful of tin
Wouldn't buy my sweat
You broke the law
It's there for people to see
Why should you get the same
As honest men like me
Now every door is closed to me
Another jail, another key, another chain
For when I come to any town
They check my papers
And they find the mark of Cain
In their eyes, I see their fear
"We do not want you here"
My rooms are full
And I've no supper to spare
I'd like to help a stranger
All we want is to be fair
I will pay in advance
I can sleep in a barn
You see how dark it is
I'm not some kind of dog
You leave my house!
Or feel the weight of my rod
We're law-abiding people here
Thanks be to God
And now I know how freedom feels
The jailer always at your heels
It is the law
This piece of paper in my hand
That makes me cursed throughout the land
It is the law
Like a cur
I walk the street
The dirt beneath their feet
Come in, Sir, for you are weary
And the night is cold out there
Though our lives are very humble
What we have, we have to share
There is wine here to revive you
There is bread to make you strong
There's a bed to rest 'til morning
Rest from pain, and rest from wrong
He let me eat my fill, I had the lion's share
This silver in my hand, costs twice what I had earned
In all those nineteen years, a lifetime of despair
And yet he trusted me
The old fool trusted me, he'd done his bit of good
I played the grateful serf and thanked him like I should
But when the house was still, I got up in the night
Took the silver, took my flight!
Tell his reverence your story
Let us see if he's impressed
You were lodging here last night
You were the honest Bishop's guest
And then out of Christian goodness
When he learned about your plight
You maintain he made a present of this silver
That is right
But my friend, you left so early
Surely something slipped your mind
You forgot I gave these also
Would you leave the best behind?
So, M'sieur, you may release him
For this man has spoken true
I commend you for your duty
And God's blessing go with you
]
But remember this,
my brother
See in this some higher plan
You must use this precious silver
To become an honest man
By the witness of the martyrs
By the Passion and the Blood
God has raised you out of darkness
I have bought your soul for God!Nossa, nossa

He fuck with me and he don't want her!
I swear I should be the bridge for you bitches
That'll help you to get over these niggas!
'Cause I don't trust no one like that
And I ain't gotta get you back
I let God handle you hoes
Said a prayer for you on the low
Wish I could be a Kardashian so I could be black
They ask if it's real, I say it's real fat
Don't get caught up in facts 'cause ain't shit real
And ain't shit funny, so fuck how you feel!
O-o-o-ohhhhh
Why couldn’t Sylvia sign me over B5
Why all these percocets got me feelin' so alive
I don't know why-y-y
I kind of fuck with Blac Chyna
She's such a lion, no Tyga
She's just a constant reminder
Niggas will sponsor vagina
I ain't trippin', no
No time, I'm too busy gettin' it on my own!
'Cause I don't trust no one like that
And I ain't gotta get you back
I let God handle you hoes
Said a prayer for you on the low
Wish I could be a Kardashian so I could be black
Put my face over Pac

Throw a filter on that, 'cause ain't shit real
And ain't shit funny, so fuck how you feel!
O-o-o-ohhhhh, oh
Wish I could be a Kardashian, so I could be black
Ooooh yeahhhh, oh...Quit playin' games, boy

'Cause I tried so hard to just keep it goin'
Not cheat on you!
You know how I am, don't you forget
What I did for you!
I left all my hoes
Told 'em not to call and text me no more!
Now you so ungrateful
Do you know how hard it was for me to stay faithful?
Bae. I'mma make this song cry
Never let a nigga see me cry
I'mma make this song cry
'Fore I ever let 'em fuck up my eyes!
For the first time in my life
Tried to do somethin' that's right
I tried to stop thottin'' and be a wife
But I paid the ultimate price!
Guess karma caught up with me 
'Cause I done hurt so-o many!
'Cause I tried so hard to just keep it goin'
Not cheat on you!
You know how I am, don't you forget
What I did for you!
Left all my hoes
Told 'em not to call or text me no more!
Now you so ungrateful
Do you know how hard it was to be faithful?
It’s been said, you supposed to find that perfect one
And they should be the only one you wanna see
But that just ain't never been me
I can't believe the things I don't see
I'm feelin' out of control
I just miss my hoes!
So I told all my hoes
I told 'em not to call and text me no more, yeah!
Now you so ungrateful
Do you know how hard it was for me to stay faithful?

Pretty girl, put down your pen
Come over here
I'll show you how it's done
I can dance, I can drink
In the dark it's all a trick
Across the room, across the street
I'm in the moment, can't you see?
I'm a party girl
Do a twirl
See my eyes throw a glance
Can't you see I'm a natural
Life of a party girl
Funny girl, make you laugh
Want me bad
Now I feel so much better
In the back of a car
I just met them tonight
And I feel like such a star
What's your name?
What's your art?
Nobody knows about my broken heart
Yes, I'm a party girl
Crazy girl
See my lips how they move
Can't you see I'm a natural

I used to be so fragile
But now I'm so wild, so wildI see it clear, my heart is here
We got each other, let's take it from there
And if I could I'd love you a forever at time, oh, oh, oh
What we've been through no one else knows
'Cause all that matters is how far this goes
And it will go until it starts again, oh, oh
Me and you are built like armor
Nothing can stop love from loving on us
And I'm not asking for much
Just a couple of forevers
A couple of forevers
I'm the only one, you're the only one
Together 'til never
I'm talking about forever
Just a couple of forevers
I'm the only one, you're the only one
Together 'til never
It can get hard, damn it gets rough
It can get crazy but not for us
Guess we gotta struggle just to stay apart
Me and you are built like armor
Nothing can stop love from loving on us
And I'm not asking for much
Just a couple of forevers
A couple of forevers oh, ooh
I'm the only one, you're the only one
Together 'til never
Oh, I'm talking about forever
Just a couple of forevers
A couple of forevers, ooh ooh
I'm the only one, you're the only one
Together 'til never, never never
Can you see it, oh oh ooh oh
Can you see the signs from above
It's so blinding
There's no denying
You and me are built like armor
Nothing can stop love from loving on us
And I'm not asking you for much
A couple of forevers
Ever, ever
I'm the only one
I'm the only one, you're the only one
Together 'til never
Together 'til never
Ever
Forever and ever, and ever
Ever
Forever and ever, and ever
I'm the only one, you're the only one
Together 'til never
Together 'til neverIt's you, Javert!
I knew you wouldn't wait too long
The faithful servant at his post once more
This man's done no wrong
And he needs a doctor's care
I warned you I would not give in
I won't be swayed
Another hour yet
And then I'm yours
And all our debts are paid
The man of mercy comes again
And talks of justice
Come, time is running short
Look down, Javert
He's standing in his grave
Give way, Javert
There is a life to save
Take him, Valjean
Before I change my mind
I will be waiting
24601
Who is this man
, what sort of devil is he?
To have me caught in a trap and choose to let me go free?
It was his hour at last to put a seal on my fate
Wipe out the past
and wash me clean off the slate!
All it would take is
a flick of his knife
Vengeance was his and he gave me back my life!
Damned if I'll live in the debt of a thief!
Damned if I'll yield at the end of the chase
I am the Law and the Law is not mocked
I'll spit his pity right back in his face
There is nothing on earth that we share
It is either Valjean or Javert!
How can I now allow this man
To hold dominion over me
This desperate man whom I have hunted
He gave me my life, he gave me freedom
I should have perished by his hand
It was his right
It was my right to die as well
Instead, I live... but live in hell
And my thoughts fly apart
Can this man be believed?
Shall his sins be forgiven?
Shall his crimes be reprieved?
And must I now begin to doubt
Who never doubted all these years
?
My heart is stone and still it trembles
The world I have known is lost in shadow
Is he from heaven or from hell?
And does he know
That granting me my life today
This man has killed me even so?
I am reaching, but I fall
And the stars are black and cold
As I stare into the void
Of a world that cannot hold
I'll escape now from that world
From the world of Jean Valjean
There is nowhere I can turn
There is no way to go on!How strange
This feeling that my life's begun at last
This change
Can people really fall in love so fast?
What's the matter with you, Cosette?
Have you been too much on your own?
So many things unclear
So many things unknown
In my life
There are so many questions and answers
That somehow seem wrong
In my life
There are times when I catch in the silence
The sigh of a far away song
And it sings
Of a world that I long to see
Out of reach
Just a whisper away
Waiting for me!
Does he know I'm alive?
Do I know if he's real?
Does he see what I saw?
Does he feel what I feel?
In my life
I'm no longer alone
Now the love in my life is so near
Find me now
Find me here
Dear Cosette
You're such a lonely child
How pensive
How sad you seem to me
Believe me
Were it within my power
I'd fill each passing hour
How quiet it must be
I can see
With only me for company
There's so little I know
That I'm longing to know
About the child that I was in a time long ago
There's so little you say
Of the life you have known
Why you keep to yourself
Why we're always alone
So dark, so dark
And deep
The secrets that you keep
In my life
I have all that I want
You are loving and gentle and good
But Papa
Dear Papa
In your eyes I am just like a child
Who is lost in a wood
No more words
No more words
It’s a time that is dead
There are words
That are better unheard
Better unsaid
In my life
I'm no longer a child
And I yearn for the truth that you know
Of the years
Years ago
You will learn
Truth is given by God to us all
In our time
In our
turn
In my life
She has burst like the music of angels
The light of the sun
And my life
Seems to stop
as if something is over
And something has scarcely begun
Eponine
You're the friend who has brought me here
Thanks to you, I am one with the Gods
And heaven is near!
And I saw through a world that is new
That is free
Every word that he says
Is a dagger in me
In my life
There's been no one like him anywhere
Anywhere
Where he is
If he asked
I'd be his
In my life
There is someone who touches my life
Waiting near
Waiting hereThey are not nice
They're mostly noise
They swear like men
They screw like boys
I know there's nothing in their hearts
But every time I take one in my arms
It starts
The movie in my mind
The dream they leave behind
A scene I can't erase
And in a strong G.I's embrace
Flee this life
Flee this place
The movie plays and plays
The screen before me fills
He takes me to New York
He gives me dollar bills
Our children laugh all day
And eat too much ice cream
And life is like a dream
Dream, the dream I long to find
The movie in my mind
I will not cry
I will not think
I'll do my dance
I'll make them drink
When i make love
It won't be me
And if they hurt me
I'll just close my eyes and see
They are not nice
They're mostly noise
The movie in my mind
They kill like men
They die like boys
The dream that fills my head
A man who will not kill
Who'll fight for me instead
He'll keep us safe all day
So no one comes at night
To blow the dream away
Dream, the dream I have to find
The movie in my mind
And in a strong G.I's embrace
Flee this life
Flee this place
A world that's far away
Where life is not unkind
The movie in my mindYou keep telling me that I am free to go
But I am addicted to you
It's a lie, it's a lie, it's a lie
When I'm not here, you're alone
Can you walk by your own?
Don't you lie, don't you lie, don't you lie
And I think you should know
That I won't let you go
It was like a million times
I'm singing a lullaby
And I think you should know
That I won't let it go
I thought that I was enough
But I don't wanna say goodbye
And I think you should know
It was hard to say
Every minute that we spent together
Doesn't matter for you
It's a lie, it's a lie, you're a liar
Every time you wanna walk the door
I don't blame you
I don't blame you
And I think you should know
That I won't let go
It was like a million times
I am singing a lullaby
And I think you should know
That I won't let you go
I thought that it was enough
But I don't wanna say goodbye
And I think you should know
And I think you should know
Hard for me, hard for me
It's hard for me, hard for me, hard for me
It's hard for me, hard for me, hard for me
It's hard for meHey you
It's really good to see you
I've got so much to tell you
But you should know I'm doing fine
Hey you
Had a story to tell you
But honestly I can't even remember
Really doesn't matter
Never seen you this happy
Never seen you so peaceful
Even though you can't hold me
Hurts you, hurts me, but you're here
When the days are getting dark
Nights are getting hard
I see you
And when I laugh until I cry
I don't even know why I feel you
Hey you
Funny thing I found that old t-shirt we thought you lost it
It's still the softest
You know it made me
Put on your favorite Radiohead song
It took me back to
When we were driving down Laurel Canyon
And too fast you know you never slowed down
Final days were the hardest
I didn't think they would be your last
Hope you know I forgive you
Give anything to get them back
But know that everything's okay
I'm doing okay without you
I know you had to go away
I'll tell you everyday I miss you
Hey you
I know you always liked to get the last words in
But before you go
You should know
I love you more
I said soElphaba, shut up! First of all
I can't harbor a fugitive, I am an unelected official
And why should I help you?
You fly around Oz trying to rescue Animals you've never even met
And not once have you ever thought to use your powers to
rescue me!
All of my life, I've depended on you
How do you think that feels?
All of my life, I've depended on you
And this hideous chair with wheels
Scrounging for scraps of pity to pick up
And longing to kick up my heels
Nessa, there isn't a spell for everything
The... the power is mysterious, it not like cobbling up a pair of... wait!

Finally, something good

Yes?
Oh, Nessa
Surely now I'll matter less to you
You won't mind my leaving here tonight
Leaving?
Yes
That ball that's being staged
Announcing Glinda is engaged
To Fiyero
Glinda?
Yes Nessa, that's right
I've got to go appeal to her
Express the way I feel for her
Nessa,
I lost my heart
to Glinda from the moment I first saw her. You know that
Lost your heart?
Well, we'll see about that
Nessa, let him go
Did you think I'd let you leave me here flat?!
Don't come any closer!
You're going to lose your heart to me, I tell you!
If I have, I have to... magic spell you

Boq, what is it?
My heart... it feels... it feels like it's shrinking!
Oh, Elphaba, do something!
I can't. You can't reverse a spell once it's been cast
Then what do we do?! This is all your fault! If you had not shown me that horrenible book
I've got to find another spell. It's the only thing that might work
Save him please, just save him
My poor Boq, my sweet, my brave him
Don't leave me 'til my sorry life has ceased
Alone and loveless here
Just the girl in the mirror
Just her and me, Wicked Witch of the East!
We deserve each otherI don't wanna keep you waiting
That's why you blame it on me
You just give me your secrets
And I wanted to, yeah
'Cause this was on you, baby
And it's only true, yeah
I'm gonna feel it
Feel it so strong
This is making me alive
We don't even have to say goodbye
I'm gonna feel it
Feel it so strong
This is tryna make me alive
We don't even have to say goodbye
I wanted you-ou-ou-ou, you-ou-ou-ou
This is making me alive
We don't even have to say goodbye
I want you-ou-ou-ou, you-ou-ou-ou
This is tryna make me alive
We don't even have to say goodbye
Even if I want to play this
'Cause that's what they're expecting from me, yeah
I will never let you burden it
And this is about to
'Cause this was on you, baby
And it's only true, yeah
I'm gonna feel it
Feel it so strong
This is making me alive
We don't even have to say goodbye
I'm gonna feel it
Feel it so strong
This is tryna make me alive
We don't even have to say goodbye
I wanted you-ou-ou-ou, you-ou-ou-ou

We don't even have to say goodbye
I want you-ou-ou-ou, you-ou-ou-ou
This is tryna make me alive
We don't even have to sayIt wakes me up at night
It needs to share its light
It doesn't get how dark it is outside
It warms the rising sun
It kisses everyone
It doesn't remember the hate of yesterday
Oh, can't you hear it in my voice?
Oh, can't you see it in my eyes?
Love, love is alive in me
And when my golden crown
Becomes a cup of doubt
I try to remember all I need is all around
Oh, can't you hear it in my voice?
Oh, can't you see it in my eyes?
Love, love is alive in me 
Oh, can't you hear it in my voice?
Oh, can't you see it in my eyes?
Love, love is alive
Oh, can't you feel it in my touch?
Know that I'll always have enough
Love, love is alive in me He thinks th
a
t man is me
He knew him at a glance
That stranger he has found
This man could be my chance
Why should I save his hide?
Why should I right this wrong?
When I have come so far
And struggled for so long?
If I speak, I am condemned
If I stay silent, I am damned
I am the master of hundreds of workers
They all look to me
Can I abandon them, how would they live
If I am not free?
If I speak,
I am condemned
If I stay silent, I am damned
Who am I?
Can I condemn this man to slavery?
Pretend I do not feel his agony?
This innocent who wears my face
Who goes to judgement in my place
Who am I?
Can I conceal myself for evermore?
Pretend I'm not the man I was before?
And must my name until I die
Be no more than an alibi?
Must I lie?
How can I ever face my fellow men?
How can I ever face myself again?
My soul belongs to God, I know
I made that bargain long ago
He gave me hope, when hope was gone
He gave me strength to journey on
Who am I? Who am I?
I'm Jean Valjean
And so Javert, you see it's true
That man bears no more guilt than you
Who am I? 24601!There are days when I feel so afraid I
Can hardly remember to breathe
When reality crashes in wave after wave
Pulling me further beneath
So what's the point in planning for a future
If it all can be stolen away?
It's all I can do to hold on and survive
When the colors have faded to grey
But my children need so much more from me
And they give me the strength to go on
Whatever may come
All that matters now
Is where I go from here
There's an easier way
If I live for today
The beating of my heart
Is all that matters
He makes sense of all of my chaos
In ways I can never explain
He turns all of my sadness into a smile
He's helping me live life again
It's the light in the eyes of my children
It's the sound of their laughter once more
It's a glimpse of a life I dared only to dream
And a dream only life could restore
And I know that some may not understand
But he's guiding me safely to shore
Not afraid anymore
All that matters now
Is where I go from here
There's an easier way
If I live for today
The singing in my heart
Is all that matters
It takes me far away
There's an easier way
If I live for today
The singing in my heart
Is all that matters[Verse 1: Snelle,

Ik zou eigenlijk juist nu
Een arm om je heen willen slaan
Zoveel nieuws

zo stil is het op straat
Een elleboog was nooit zo beschaafd
En er is wel meer raars want
Ik bel m'n moeder met een trilling in de stem
Door wat er moest van de minister-president
Goed bedoeld, stiekem best een beetje eng
En ik denk aan
Alle zorg om gezondheid en banen
Op televisie is nu alles zo beladen
Ik denk aan grootmoeders en vaders
Maar gek genoeg brengt het ons samen

Zo zitten d'r nu duizenden studenten
In de lente op hun kamer
En ondertussen kneiterharde werkers
In de zorg, die amper slapen
, maar met
Zeventien miljoen mensen
Is het best wel even schrikken
Zit de helft inmiddels thuis, maar met
Zeventien miljoen mensen
Met de neus in dezelfde richting komen we hier uit, met
Zeventien miljoen mensen
Op dat hele kleine stukje aarde
Die schrijf je niet de wetten voor
Die laat je in hun waardeIt's time to leave it all behind
It's time to pick up the pieces of my scattered mind
And after all my petals fall
I can finally find beauty beneath once and for all
I've spent way too long judging myself
Running from truth into someone else's arms
But I'm done, the battle's begun, the battle's begun
There's fire in me, deep down in my veins
These clouds in my head, they're not gonna rain
There's fight in my heart, there's hope in my eyes
There's hope in my eyes
I push to the limits, I climb every wall
I keep on believing anything's possible
I run 'til I'm breathless, I stand ten feet tall
I keep on believing anything's possible
Woah oh oh oh oh oh, anything's possible
Woah oh oh oh oh oh
It's time to crack the open door
It's time to leave every teardrop on the bathroom floor
If I'm scared, I'll go in scared
Yeah, I've got nothing to lose, it's only up from here
I've spent way too long judging myself
Running from truth into someone else's arms
But I'm done, the battle's begun, the battle's begun
I push to the limits, I climb every wall
I keep on believing anything's possible
I run 'til I'm breathless, I stand ten feet tall
I keep on believing anything's possible
Woah oh oh oh oh oh, anything's possible
Woah oh oh oh oh oh
Yeah, the night is all around me, 'round me
But in the dark, the stars they found me, found me
I'm here, woah, woah, woah
I'm gonna push to the limits, I climb every wall
I keep on believing
Anything's possible
I run 'til I'm breathless, I stand ten feet tall
I keep on believing
Anything's possible
Woah oh oh oh oh oh
Woah oh oh oh oh oh
Anything's possible
Anything's possibleHitmaka

Two-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-oah!Turn it inside out so I can see
The part of you that's driftin' over me
And when I wake you're, you're never there
And when I sleep you're, you're everywhere
You're everywhere
Just tell me how I got this far
Just tell me why you're here and who you are
'Cause every time I look, you're never there
And every time I sleep, you're always there
'Cause you're everywhere to me
And when I close my eyes, it's you I see
You're everything I know that makes me believe
I'm not alone
I'm not alone
I recognize the way you make me feel
It's hard to think that you might not be real
I sense it now, the water's getting deep
I try to wash the pain away from me
Away from me
'Cause you're everywhere to me
And when I close my eyes, it's you I see
You're everything I know that makes me believe
I'm not alone
I'm not alone
I'm not alone
Oh, whoa, whoa
And when I touch your hand
It's then I understand
The beauty that's within
It's now that we begin
You always light my way
There never comes a day
No matter where I go
I always feel you so
'Cause you're everywhere to me
And when I close my eyes, it's you I see
You're everything I know that makes me believe
I'm not alone
'Cause you're everywhere to me
And when I catch my breath, it's you I breathe
You're everything I know that makes me believe
I'm not alone
You're in everyone I see
So tell me
Do you see me?I would run down the street bare feet
If I could write my destiny
I can't except you being over me
But when it comes to you
I'll believe anything
Just like when I believe she was nothing
She was something
You went running
How you gonna do me like that
I still want you back
Man I still want you back
Oh, Lord have your mercy
For loving him religiously
I should be praying for better things
Instead of praying for a man
Who don't give a fuck about me
Sometimes they do come back
And sometimes they don't
Sometimes the love will last
But sometimes it won't
If I could write the perfect script
It would be on some notebook shit
And I don't like ya' mama
But I hope she fine
I think about her from time to time
I never felt so confused
I never felt so used and abused
What the hell did I do to you
Where's the man that stood in the rain
Brought me Sunflowers everyday
Sometimes they do come back
And sometimes they don't
They tell you that they love you
Then turn around and leave you there
It isn't right it isn't fair
I can't believe you left me here
Sometimes they do come back
And sometimes they don't
And I miss you so bad
But I know that you goneDrip drip

Though the world is cold, just remember who you are...
And I pray that you'll never have a rainy day, and no matter what the  people say
Even when it hurts, it'll be okay...
Tomorrow brings new promise, so don't worry 'bout today;
The first time I saw you, I knew my life had changed...
I would've been dead and gone, but I found purpose when I brought you home
And even though I'm not there to tuck you in every day, I'm not far away...
This is what a mother prays...
Last night, I prayed on a falling star that you'll never have a broken heart;
Though the world is cold, please remember who you are...
And I pray that you'll never have a rainy day, and no matter what the people say
In your darkest hours, I'll help guide your way...
Those dreams you have, I want you to chase 'em, chase 'em;
This bond that we got, let nobody break it, break it...
Even when I'm on the road, and I can't see your face, this music will never take your place;
I love you Chase, I love my Chase...
And that's why last night, I prayed on a falling star that you'll never have a broken heart;
Though the world is cold, remember who you are...
And I pray that you'll never have a rainy day, and no matter what the people say
Even when it hurts, it'll be okay...
And I pray that you'll never have a rainy day, and no matter what the people say
In your darkest hours, I'll help light your way...
This what a mother prays...
Your daddy loves you and I love you too;
Sorry we couldn't work it out for you, but we gon' do what's best for you...
I pray, oh, I pray;
I love you, cause this is what a mother prays...Break down

I was scared to death, I was losing my mind 
I couldn’t close my eyes, I was pacing all night 
I think I found the light at the end of the tunnel 
I couldn’t find the truth, I was going under
But I won’t hide inside
I gotta get out, gotta get out, gotta get out, gotta get out
Lonely inside and light the fuse
Light it now, light it now, light it now
And now I will start living today, today, today
I close the door
I got this new beginning and I will fly
I’ll fly like a cannonball
Like a cannonball
Like a cannonball
I’ll fly, I’ll fly, I’ll fly like a cannonball
Freedom
I let go of fear and the peace came quickly
Freedom
I was in the dark and then it hit me
I chose suffering and pain and I live for the rain
I know, I gotta get out into the world again
But I won’t hide inside
I gotta get out, gotta get out, gotta get out, gotta get out
Lonely inside and light the fuse
Light it now, light it now, light it now
And now I will start living today, today, today
I close the door
I got this new beginning and I will fly
I’ll fly like a cannonball
Like a cannonball
Like a cannonball
I’ll fly, I’ll fly, I’ll fly like a cannonball

I gotta get out into the world again
And now I will start living today, today, today
I close the door
I got this new beginning and I will fly
I’ll fly like a cannonball

Cosette, it's turned so cold
Cosette, it's past your bedtime
You've played the day away
And soon it will be night
Come to me, Cosette, the light is fading
Don't you see the evening star appearing?
Come to me, and rest against my shoulder
How fast the minutes fly away and every minute colder
Hurry near, another day is dying
Don't you hear, the winter wind is
crying?
There's a darkness which comes without a warning
But I will sing you lullabies and wake you in the morning
]
Oh, Fantine,
our time is running out
But Fantine, I swear this on my life
Look, M'sieur, where all the children play
Be at peace, be at peace evermore
My Cosette—
Shall live in my protection
Take her now
Your child will want for nothing
Good M'sieur, you come from God in Heaven
And none shall ever harm Cosette
As long as I am living
Take my hand
The night grows ever colder
Take my child
I give her to your keeping
Then I will keep you warm
Take shelter from the storm
For God's sake,
please stay till I am sleeping
And tell Cosette I love her
And I'll see her when I wakeI would be the apple of his eye
He would treat me like his grand prize
Trophy, make me feel every bit worth it
I would be his centerpiece and
He'd show me off while we're at the Grammys
Winning, nominated, they'd hate it
But even though you don't appreciate me
You can't see what I see
But someone will believe in me
And the love that I'm giving
Drake would love me
He would kiss me
He would touch me like I need
Drake wouldn't leave me
He would keep me
Never break his promises
I'd be the best he ever had
He'd be on his best behavior
He would make me so proud
Drake would love me
I would never ever have to cry and
If I did, yes, he would make me right
Take care of me
For me he'd do anything
He wouldn't change
He always stay the same
He would tell the truth
He wouldn't play no games
His motto would be giving me his all
Oh I know that you don't appreciate me
You can't see what I see
Someone will believe in me
And the love that I'm giving
Drake would love me
He would kiss me
He would touch me like I need
Drake wouldn't leave me
He would keep me
Never break his promises
I'd be the best he ever had
He'd be on his best behavior
He would make me so proud
Drake would love me
There comes a time in a woman's life
When she knows it ain't worth a fight
This can't be love, this can't be life
I'm a good woman, not afraid to let go
That's how I know
Drake would love me
He would kiss me
He would touch me like I need
Drake wouldn't leave me
He would keep me
Never break his promises
I'd be the best he ever had
He'd be on his best behavior
He would make me so proud
Oh, wooooah, yeah
Drake would love me, love me, love me
Drake would love me, me, yesEy, höru mej bae? Höru mej bae?

Yey-yey, yey-yeyWhat have I done? Sweet Jesus, what have I done?
Become a thief in the night, become a dog on the run
Have I fallen so far and is the hour so late
That nothing remains but the cry of my hate?
The cries in the dark that nobody hears
Here where I stand at the turning of the years
If there's another way to go
I missed it twenty long years ago
My life was a war that could never be won
They gave me a number and murdered Valjean
When they chained me and left me for dead
Just for stealing a mouthful of bread
Yet why did I allow that man
To touch my soul and teach me love?
He treated me like any other
He gave me his trust, he called me brother
My life he claims for God above
Can such things be?
For I had come to hate the world
This world that always hated me
Take an eye for an eye!
Turn your heart into stone!
This is all I have lived for!
This is all I have known!
One word from him and I'd be back
Beneath the lash, upon the rack
Instead he offers me my freedom
I feel my shame inside me like a knife
He told me that I have a soul
How does he know?
What spirit comes to move my life?
Is there another way to go?
I am reaching, but I fall
And the night is closing in
And I stare into the void
To the whirlpool of my sin
I'll escape now from that world
From the world of Jean Valjean
Jean Valjean is nothing now
Another story must begin!I miss you in the day
I miss you in the night
I miss the way we used to talk but I don't miss your lies
I miss the way we laughed
You used to make me smile
Maybe you'll see when we can't be
And then you'll come around
I needed love
But I wasn't enough
You can't say I didn't try, it might make me cry
It's gon hurt, no lie
Miss you but goodbye
I wish that you could change
But I don't think you can
I wish that you could feel this pain
So you could understand
I hate you're not the one
I hate you moving on
Cuz my bed it was made for two but I sleep here alone
I needed love
But I wasn't enough
You can't say I didn't try, it might make me cry
It's gon hurt, no lie
Miss you but goodbye
And I hold on to denial
And I pick up but no dial
But I wanna, I wanna, I wanna know
If there's any hope
My head says,"let it go."
My heart says,"fight for, fight for who you love."
But I'm giving up
I needed love
But I wasn't enough
You can't say I didn't try, it might make me cry
It's gon hurt, no lie
Miss you but goodbyeMama said it would happen to me
But I never did believe
I'm young I'm fine I'm in my prime
This is not the time
To be sitting at home crying
While your ass is out here lying
Hang it up You can stop your trying
I'm giving up I'm done with love
It would be nice to love you
But I got too much, too much to do
Everyday I'm thinking of you
I'm suppose to be bulletproof
Damn, I'm feeling some kind of way
Oh damn, wanna love you but can it wait
Oh damn, it maybe hard to walk away
I'm feeling some type of way
I tried but it didn't work
In love I always hurt
Should have never gave you my number
Could it work can't help but wonder
I got too much to lose
You got too much to prove
Don't wanna end up like them other dudes
Quick too go just lose
I'mma coward when it comes to love
Start to fall for someone
And then I run
From the hurt
From the pain
Sometimes you got take the chance
When you wanna love againHär var det hoppsan hejsan

Come closer, you. I like to see what I buy
The usual price for just one slice of your pie
I don't want you. No, no, Monsieur, let me go
Is this a trick? I won't pay more
No, not at all
You've got some nerve, you little whore
You've got some gall
It's the same with a tart as it is with a grocer
The customer sees what he gets in advance
It's not for the whore to say "yes sir" or "no sir"
Not for the harlot to pick or to choose
Or to lead me a dance
]
I'll kill you you bastard, try any of that
Even a whore who has gone to the bad
Won't be had by a rat
By Christ, you'll pay for what you've done
This rat will make you bleed you'll see
I guarantee, I'll make you suffer
For this disturbance of the peace
For this insult to life and property
I beg you, don't report me sir
I'll do what ever you may want
Make your excuse to the police
Tell me quickly what's the story
Who saw what and why and where
Let him give a full description
Let him answer to Javert
In this nest of whores and vipers
Let one speak who saw it all
Who laid hands on this good man here?
What's the substance of this brawl?
Javert, would you believe it
I was crossing from the park
When this prostitute attacked me
You can see she left her mark
She will answer for her actions
When you make a full report
You may rest assured, Monsieur
That she will answer to the court
There's a child who sorely needs me
Please Monsieur, she's but that high
Holy God, is there no mercy?
If I go to jail, she'll die
I have heard such protestation
Every day for twenty years
Let's have no more explanations
Save your breath and save your tears
Honest work, just reward
That's the way to please the Lord
A moment of your time, Javert
I do believe this woman's tale
But Monsieur Mayor—
You've done your duty, let her be
She needs a doctor, not a jail
But Monsieur Mayor!
Can this be?
Where will she end
This child without a friend?
I've seen your face before
Show me some way to help you
How have you come to grief
In such a place as this?
Monsieur, don't mock me now, I pray
It's hard enough I've lost my pride
You let your foreman send me away
Yes, you were there, and turned aside
I never did no wrong
My daughter's close to dying
If there's a God above
He'd let me die instead
Is it true, what I've done
To an innocent soul?
Had I only known then...
In His name, my task has just begun
I will see it done
But Monsieur Mayor!
I will see it done
But Monsieur Mayor!
I will see it done

Tell that bitch to move back!Songtekst van Marco Borsato, Armin van Buuren & Davina Michelle – "Hoe Het Danst"
Sleutels vast, de deurknop heb ik in m'n hand
Maar ik twijfel of ik nog wel echt naar binnen kan
Jouw iedere beweging lijkt bij mij vandaan
'k Heb je hart zo lang niet open meer zien staan
Wil je weten hoe het danst zonder mij?
Misschien heb je meer balans zonder mij
Als het moet zet ik een stapje opzij
Als het beter, als dat beter is
Heeft het leven dan meer glans zonder mij?
Krijgt de liefde weer een kans zonder mij?
Als dat echt zo is dan laat ik je vrij
Als het beter, als dat beter is
Wil niet zeggen dat ik jou niet mis
De voordeur die gaat open en ik sla weer dicht
Al staat wat ik wil zeggen wel op mijn gezicht, oh
Ik kan niet met je praten dus ik hou me stil
Maar het voelt of je voor mij niet vechten wil
Wil je weten hoe het danst zonder mij?
Misschien heb je meer balans zonder mij
Als het moet zet ik een stapje opzij
Als dat beter, als dat beter is
Heeft het leven dan meer glans zonder mij?
Krijgt de liefde weer een kans zonder mij?
Als dat echt zo is dan laat ik je vrij
Als het beter, als dat beter is
Wil niet zeggen dat ik jou niet mis
Ga maar kijken hoe het danst
Ga maar kijken hoe het danst
Het is niet dat ik niet wil
Maar heel de weg lijk ik vergeten
Zou niet weten welke richting
Welke weg nog leidt naar jou
Sleutels vast, de deurknop heb ik in m'n hand
Ik leer vast wel hoe het danst zonder jou
Ook al mis ik de balans zonder jou
Oh, ik hoop dat ik het kan zonder jou
Als het beter, als dat beter is
Ga maar kijken hoe het danst zonder mij
Geef de liefde weer een kans zonder mij
Als het moet zet ik een stapje opzij
Als het beter, als het beter is
Ga maar kijken hoe het danst
Ga maar kijken hoe het danst
Wil je weten hoe het danst zonder mij?
Misschien heb je meer balans zonder mij
Als het moet zet ik een stapje opzij
Als het beter, als dat beter is
Wil niet zeggen dat ik jou niet misYou know what will happen when we connect right?
I let you know you worthy

Hey, oh-woah, babe
Happy birthdayTzeitel you're the oldest. Yente has to arrange a match for you before she can make one for me
Oh Yente, Yente!
Well, somebody has to arrange the matches
Young people can't decide these things themselves
She might bring someone wonderful—
Someone interesting—
And well off—
And important—
Matchmaker, Matchmaker
Make me a match
Find me a find
Catch me a catch
Matchmaker, Matchmaker
Look through your book
And make me a perfect match
Matchmaker, Matchmaker
I'll bring the veil
You bring the groom
Slender and pale
Bring me a ring for I'm longing to be
The envy of all I see
For Papa
Make him a scholar
For mama
Make him rich as a king
For me, well
I wouldn't holler
If he were as handsome as anything
Matchmaker, Matchmaker
Make me a match
Find me a find
Catch me a catch
Night after night in the dark I'm alone
So find me match
Of my own
Since when are you interested in a match, Chava? I thought you had your eye on your books. And you have your eye on the Rabbi's son
Well, why not?
We have only one Rabbi and he has only one son
Why shouldn't I want the best?
Because you're a girl from a poor family
So whatever Yenta brings, you'll take, right?
Of course right!
Hodel, oh Hodel
Have I made a match for you
He's handsome, he's young
Alright, he's 62
But he's a nice man, a good catch, true?
True
I promise you'll be happy
And even if you're not
There's more to life than that—
Don't ask me what
Chava, I found him
Won't you be a lucky bride
He's handsome, he's tall
That is from side to side
But he's a nice man, a good catch, right?
Right
You heard he has a temper
He'll beat you every night
But only when he's sober
So you're alright
Did you think you'd get a prince?
Well I'll find the best I can
With no dowry, no money, no family background
Be glad you got a man
Matchmaker, Matchmaker
You know that I'm
Still very young
Please, take your time
Up to this minute
I misunderstood
That I could get stuck for good
Dear Yenta
See that he's gentle
Remember
You were also a bride
It's not that
I'm sentimental
It's just that I'm terrified
Matchmaker, Matchmaker
Plan me no plans
I'm in no rush
Maybe I've learned
Playing with matches
A girl can get burned
So
Bring me no ring
Groom me no groom
Find me no find
Catch me no catch
Unless he's a matchless match]
God on high, hear my prayer
In my need, you have always been there
He is young, he's afraid
Let him rest, heaven blessed
Bring him home
Bring him home
Bring him home
He's like the son I might have known
If God had granted me a son
The summers die, one by one
How soon they fly, on and on
And I am old and will be gone
Bring him peace, bring him joy
He is young, he is only a boy
You can take, you can give
Let him be, let him live
If I die, let me die
Let him live
Bring him home
Bring him home
Bring him home]
Everyone here, you know your place
Brujon, Babet, Claqusous!
You, Montparnasse, watch for the law
With Eponine, take care
You turn on the tears
No mistakes, my dears
These bloody students on our streets
Here they come slumming once again
Our Eponine would kiss their feet
She never had a scrap of brain
Hey, Eponine, what's up today
I haven't seen you much about
Here, you can always catch me in
Mind the police don't catch you out
]
Here, whatcher doing with all them books
I could have been a student, too
Don't judge a girl on how she looks
I know a lot of things, I do
Poor Eponine, the things you know
You wouldn't find in books like these
I like the way you grow your hair
I like the way you always tease
]
Little he knows... little he sees
]
Here's the old boy, stay on the job
And watch out for the law
Stay out of this
But Eponine—
You'll be in trouble here
It's not your concern
You'll be in the clear
]
Who is that man?
Leave me alone
Why is he here?
Hey, Eponine!
I didn't see you there, forgive me
Please M'sieur, come this way
Here's a child that ain't eaten today
Save a life, spare a sou
God rewards all the good that you do
Wait a bit— know that face
Ain't the world a remarkable place?
Men like me don't forget
You're the bastard that borrowed Cosette
What is this? Are you mad?
No, Monsieur, you don't know what you do
You know me, you know me
I'm a con, just like you
It's the police!  Disappear!
Run for it!  It's Javert!
Another brawl in the square
Another stink in the air
Was there a witness to this?
Well, let him speak to Javert
M'sieur, the streets are not safe
But let these vermin beware
We'll see that justice is done
Look upon this fine collection
Crawled from underneath a stone
This swarm of worms and maggots
Could have picked you to the bone
I know this man over here
I know his name and his trade
And on your witness, M'sieur
We'll see him suitably paid
But where's the gentleman gone
And why on earth did he run?
You will have a job to catch him
He's the one you should arrest
No more bourgeois when you scratch him
Than that brand upon his chest!
Could it be he's some old jailbird
That the tide now washes in?
Heard my name and started running
Had the brand upon his skin
And the girl who stood beside him
When I turned they both had gone
Could he be the man I've hunted?
Could it be he's Jean Valjean?
In the absence of a victim
Dear Inspector, may I go?
And remember when you've nicked him
It was me who told you so!
Let the old man keep on running
I will run him off his feet
Everyone about your business
Clear this garbage off the street!There's a smile without a home
There's a heart that can't beat no more
How could she be the one you want
When I'm giving you so much
In this house we made are own
You have torn it down to nothing
And for the moment of a stroke
You let it all go
Now she's calling your phone
Rolling her eyes at me
Like I'm the one who did wrong
Tryna play my role
But
I can't even hate on her
Cause i know you got no heart
I can't even hate on her
Cause I know how low you go
And you made it feel right
When you know you was wrong
So I can't even hate on her
See that moment it can't be erased
Memories that can't be replaced
How could you even look me in my face
Years ruined in one day
Oh girl she don't even know
That grown boys don't even grow
She will always be alone
So when she's calling my phone
Next time I'mma let her know
She can have you I'm gone
Man love can be so cold
But I can't even hate on her
Cause i know you got no heart
I can't even hate on her
Cause I know how low you go
And you made it feel right
When you know you was wrong
So I can't even hate on her
I've giving my everything
But you took it all from me
I hope she can be all you need
Cause I can't be it
I can't even hate on her
Cause i know you got no heart
I can't even hate on her
Cause I know how low you go
And you made it feel right
When you know you was wrong
So I can't even hate on her
I've giving my everything
But you took it all from meNice and...
 
 
 
You know I can never do
Things that, you want me to
The way I appear to you
May not be true to you
So don't get your hopes too high
And don't be like other guys 
Assuming that every girl is just like that type
Mennn...
Runnin' the same ol' sayin'
*talking* No more questions, no more games
Some people think I'm nice
Some people think I'm nasty
But if you really want to know
Just ask meeeeeee...
And I'll say I'm nicety
Hooooo-hoooo-hoooo, say I'm nicety
Nice and... 
 
You said you would treat me right
And I'd never be alone
*talking* But men'll say anything
Just to try to take you home 
But don't get your hopes too high
Cause I've got to keep it tight
And that's the way it will stay
Until I feel it's right 
Mennn...
Runnin the same ol' sayin
*talking* No more questions, no more games
Nicetyyyyyy...
It's got to be nicety
Hooooo-hoooo-hoooo, say I'm nicety
Nicety-eeeeee...
You can call me nicety
...
Some people think I'm nice
Some people think I'm nasty
But if you really want to know
Just ask MEEEEEEEE...
And I'll say I'm -
Nicety, or whatever you wanna call it
Ask my opinion and I think that all it is
Is just an excuse to givin the boots
For dollar and cents, and remain innocent
Dre with the Ruthless Attack, check it
Cause all that you talkin about ain't Jack!
Step off of that, try a new approach
You get smoked because I ain't no joke
Yeah, yeah...
Nice and... 
You can call me nicety
Just say I'm nicety
You can call me nicety
Nicetyyyyy....
Just call me nicety
Hoooooo-hooooooo-hoooo, just call me nicety
Nicetyyyyyy....
