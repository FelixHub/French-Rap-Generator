Well, there ain't no other other
Well, there ain't no other other, Lord
There ain't no other other
Well, there ain't no other other
Well, there ain't no other other
There ain't no other other
Well I better not fuck this up
Well I better not fuck this up
Ah, long a way
Well we better not fuck this up
Well we better not fuck this up
Ah, leave it lone
Well it's two lines on 'em
And were pairing 'em down the cost
Well it's two lines on 'em
Well ya better not put up a fuss
Well, I’m wide awake
Whoo
Well you better not fuck this up
Well you better not fuck this up
While I’m away
Well, there ain't no other other
Well, there ain't no other other
I 'ould bet a fortune
Where they tugging the bed, the foreground
Well, there ain't no other other
Well, there ain't no, well there ain't no
Have we been here before?
Where they tugging the bed, the foreground
Well I’m on my big bean field
In the palm of your hand
And the palms are decimation where the glass glaze lay dead
Well there's six whole fucking nations
And who knows where they lay
Well you won't baylta patch that
With a one slap slain sleigh
When that bread dont even cost no bread
On my Mast head
And that bed ain't even made up and the Swing side caped up
Well there's Indians in the graveyard and we built on top them
Well I wanna comprehend you
But that's hard to give way, ah
Do we really know what happened to the
Clamped winter pass?
I would'a bet a coat over highway pass
For every lil' young ripple slapped on the back
Well I wanna comprehend you, said no overpass
The very young thing chad with the sweater back
Said he ain't known no love so he just attacks
But I known a couple lovers, some were quarterbacks
See can't you see hon that there's two a' that
Now?
Well, there ain't no other other 
There ain't no other other
Well, there ain't no other other
Well, there ain't no other other
For by a still water(I will lay laid open… I will lay laid open
I do it 'cause I'm a family man
)
Well, I met her at a hard grave
A heatwave, handshake way
But the Carmex stayed
Come back, do not answer the door
Oh, we met up like a ski team
10 feet out
With a cane man's clout
(
My place of clear water
)
With a beat in now
And the walls turned in
And your chest came out
'Cause you weren't too scared
Not amounting to your mother or your father
It's the memory of future 'gainst thee
As the passing end of the ashes hits the ground that you weep
And you'll know we'll need a minute to repair
So when you teach, you better teach 'em to share
So when they're standing by a river, you won't have to say:
"You panicked on me"
Oh, we met up at the High Line
Great park
Rose bark birch
And the two stich hurt
You had this torn 'Pac tee
And some horrible knees
Still standing fast
You always put your heart on your back
And we rose up above the G league
In a Teepee gloss
Where your tea leaves, boss?
Well, I got your back now
Not amounting to your mother or your father
It's the memory of future 'gainst thee
As the passing end of the ashes hits the ground that you weep
And you'll know we'll need a minute to repair
So when you teach, you better teach 'em to share
So when you're standing by a river, you won't have to say:
"You panicked on me"
'Cause now I'm a devotee
I'm a devotee
I do it 'cause I'm a family man
I will lay laid open
I will lay laid openHide in the grass

Look at that climb
When it's throwing in a nickel you’ll get out a dime
Too patterned, too close
Too flattered, too broke
Now look at you go
Took the morning to float
Took the morning to find
I got a vision of a mission but an awkward vibe
Too livid, too scared
Too loving, too closed
Now look at you know
When the cause is dead on arrival
And you coulda shoulda woulda for free
Now look at your post script, every minute
It's a very slow thing to have glean
So maybe you know
Or maybe you don't
It isn’t time for a fitting of a passing cloak
Too forward, too fine
Too patient, too wise
Now look at you shine
Took the matter to house
Took the matter to mouth
With the feeling that I'm fishing in a harbor now
Too clever, too kind
Too patterned to hide
Now, look at that smile
So when the cause ain't dead on arrival
And you coulda shoulda woulda for free
Do not hang your cause on revival
Cause now looking is bringing you grief
So when the cause is dead on arrival
And you coulda shoulda woulda for free
I wouldn’t have forced it on the minute
It's a very hard thing to have grief
Ah give it a minute, we're dancing in itI was gonna give you all of my time
More time
More time
I was gonna go and get you more time
More time
More time
I was gonna give you more and more time
I ain't lying
I was gonna give you loads of more time
My time
It’s my time
How am I gonna get you out of my mind?
More time
More time
How am I gonna get you out of my mind?
More time
More time
I was gonna give us more and more time
I ain't lying
I ain't lying
I was gonna get you more and more time
I ain't lying
I ain't lying
Every bit assaulted, but lauded, and part of the profits
On account of the coffin
Don’t call me a maudlin
Tongue knotted often
Do you remember when we went and took apart your closet?
Took apart your closet
More time
Then I was gonna go and get you more time
More time
More time
More time
More time
My time
More time
More time
Our time
I was gonna put it in my pocket
For every drying socket
But hocked it when I marked it
When you're alone
I gave you all of my time
But you really want
But you really want
But you really want
More time

How important you will be
Why don’t you lay it down right beside me
Won't you lay it all by me
I am not an apparition
But I’ll haunt you
You'll see
Clad in ballads, wine and orchids
Cause I know the kind you seek
You used to lay down all around me
You used to lay it all by me
No it's not just adulation
I will hold you for me
Cut the grass, tend the flowers
Downing bottles by the crease
Light a smoke up in the sun room
And pretend I’m My Tree
Prove it not
Rock of ages
In a row
Their lies to me
Winter costs you peace of mind now
Winter cost your valentine
Why won't you come back on the runner
Won't you come right backside
I'll be singing for your health
I'll be righteous you’ll seeSign it

Hiding in the tour
Hiding in your door

No time for arguments
No time for love like now
There's no time in the bardo
No time in the in-between
No time for love like now
There's no time for dancing
No time for undecideds
No time for love like now
Where did this all begin to change?
The lockdown memories can't sustain
This glistening, hanging free fall
I turned away from the glorious light
I turned my head and cried
Whatever waiting means in this new place
I am waiting for you
There's no time for honey
No time for psalms and thresholds
Whisper a sweet prayer sigh
Where did this all begin to change?
The lockdown memories can't sustain
This glistening, hanging free fall
I turned away from the glorious light
I turned my head and cried
Whatever waiting means in this new place
I am waiting for you
Your voice is echoing love, love, love, love, love
I hear it far, far away
And I am waiting for you
Yes, I am waiting for you

With your safety and poise
To bring me a new colour
To wind around from waist

J'crois que tout le monde veut me la mettre
Est-ce que je suis devenu parano ? Mais c'est net
Comme Hannibal Lecter, trouve le bon vecteur
Enfermé, capitonné, camisolé
Emprisonné, empoisonné, bien affligé, bien enroulé
Démystifié, alcoolisé, métallisé, dévalisé
Banalisé, analysé, verbalisé
Pénalisé, herbalisé, bien amusé
On devine qui les condés vont viser
Mais devine qui les caméras vont viser
Ça, c'est le bronzé
Ce n'est même pas la peine de demander qu'un appartement décent
Quand tu parles avec un accent, bim, on te descend
Si jamais tu as le malheur de la ramener un peu trop
Vite tu redescends

Outro : Katherin DeBoer
Skit:
The beautiful thing about music is everybody hears it differently
Some people just put the song and they hear the song and they like the song
They hear the melody, they hear what the artist is saying. Somebody else digs the guitar, somebody else digs this someone else, you know, breaks it down to different parts, people just hear the song
I mean you can't let the production take over the song, it's about the song, you know
You could have great artists, and think that it's fascinating, but people don't hear that. You gotta have your song firstThe all lip fountain
And the air strip
And the bracelets
And the children know
New songs
That are old songs for us
You could see it in the moon
It was hovering at noon
With a lick gone bad
With a good strong laugh
Phony little path
Phoning for the past
Fucking up your classic
You could see it in the moon
Drive by vroom
Drive by vroom
Drive by vroom
Drive by vroom
In the light of thee moon
In an old canoe
What’s a girl to do
In a world like you?
Holds the cluesTo say the things I want to say to you would be a crime
To admit I'm still in love with you even after all this time
I'd rather let you touch my arm until you die
Seduce me with your charms until I'm drunk on them
Go home and drink in bed and never let myself be in love like that again
Light a cigarette and think of you and walk away
Turning all the words around in my head, I won't stay
Because of all these triangles and squares
The memory we seem to share replays a distant love that plays my records on
Nevеr let myself love likе that again
Never let myself love like that again
To say the words I want to say to you would be a lie
By the time I get the courage I am drunk and you are tired
Alone down in this basement where I will write these songs
Of things I'll never say to you again and you know why
Never let myself love like that again
Never let myself love like that again
Never letOh ni
