Yeah,
D-Block
Everywhere we go-oh, people wanna know-oh
Who we arrrre, so we tell them
This is D-Block, mighty mighty D-Block
Yo,
the revolve' or the mati's cool
Knife game like Daddy Cool's, since Bally Shoes
This is real life street shit, truest and the deepest
Known niggas that go to jail just to get they teeth fixed
Think I give a fuck what you herbs say?
When I got the nigga that you trying to be watching my wordplay
Now everybody wanna be 'Pac
Till they ass really get popped and they die on the third day
The Desi's got a beautiful ring
I can hit any one of y'all, options a beautiful thing
Body is finished, maybe they can save the tooth
Call me Kiss or call me the black Babe Ruth
That many hits
--
fuck that, that many bricks
D-Block -- that many niggas, gats to your lips
My dope is two toned, but I had to change my spot
Cause it turned into a drug free school zone
 J.A.D.A
I'm top 5, dead or alive
And that's just off one LP
 Jae Hood
 Two guns up
 All I know is bitches and money, grams and guns
 Here's why they call me the Ghost
Yo, I don't give a fuck about pull out, cock back
Spin a motherfucker out, empty his chest
Leave your motherfucking whip a mess
All over the dashboard, in backseat pieces of flesh
Send niggas to the grave with they face half gone
Stomach ripped open, the beef back on
That nigga Sheek rude, I'll spit in your food
Tell the women in ya family to suck my dick
No respect, fuck that -- I'll murder you quick
Mad weapons in the trunk, bitch -- take your pick
Stick a grenade up under your fender
Stick a pineapple bomb in ya blender,
I don't care about you
You say fuck Sheek Louch? Well, fuck you too
Your father, your mother, the hole you came through
Niggas don't learn till they're kerosene-d out
Lighter to their face, they'll spit gasoline out
You want me dead, I'm right here -- do it bitch
Make me bleed till I'm motherfucking fluid-less
I ain't new at this and don't give a fuck about you
Sheek'll run up and smack the shit out you
I live this shit, it's never gon' stop
Open niggas' face with a octopus top
Face all ripped up, catch me on the block
Shells all loaded up, catch me wit the Glock
Pussy motherfuckers don't want no beef
Trip niggas down to their platinum teeth
Chase you in the house with the all black heat
Leave you just boxers and slippers on your feet
I talk reckless; I really want the coke and the money
But I'll settle for your necklace
D-Block
Jadakiss
Everywhere we go-oh, people wanna know-oh
Who we arrrre, so we tell them
This is D-Block, mighty mighty D-Block
I grew up as a young dude, chilling wit them old cats
Couldn't cop crack so I had to slang Prozac
Fuck being broke, I'm trying to cop a tan four
Trap you up like niggas get Pussy in The Sopranos
You really want beef? I'm busting the Tec
I'll hit you up in the park while you're
doing your sets
It's  
You can't get no streeter, nigga
I'm nice wit the hands but I'm better wit the heater
Old school style -- stash haze in my sock
I'll bust at you and turn your Ac' Jeep to a drop
You niggas talking like y'all can't get stuck up
I ain't an icon but y'all will still get fucked up
As we continue on, your hood you finish
Write a suicide note and get a window on
Nigga, that's the type of shit we on
Redrum Redrum -- spin it back like a Missy song
Take a cold heart to twist your mom
But it's wintertime, shotty under the snorkle
Will flip when it's dinner time
Strange days without Angela Bassett
Middle of the hood,
niggas handling plastic
Gotta watch ya head and not get popped with lead
And watch ya bread,
not get popped by Feds
Anywhere we gonna be in the hood
With the
burners and the hawks
, nigga, being the hood
Jadakiss
Everywhere we go-oh, people wanna know-oh

THIS IS THE REMIX 
You can kiss your ass goodbye 
La-da-da-da-da-daaaaa
Ay yo, the flow is here, the dough is here 
They gon' call this the hardest remix of the year 
The wrist is sickle, the 9 is nickled 
The inside tan, the outer pickle 
The dutch is rolled, the 'gnac is poured 
You running your mouth, I'm getting you jawed 
I'm waving the blade, I'm telling you back up 
You empty your pockets, I'm picking your pack up 
You can act stupid if you wanna 
Like you don't know what block I'm in front of 
I'm out in New York or down in the south 
I'm out in the trap with gold in my mouth 
They book me for the clubs and the hood 
When niggas scared to go, but Sheek Louch good 
It's loaded when I get out the car like... 
They say hate spread faster than love
So the Bentley is black, same color as the mask and the gloves
With me, I'm a send a bastard to bub
Before he get the police first and last to your gov
These dickhead niggas, you shoot 'em they bleed cum
The two pussies he's with, just make it a three-some
They growing up quick, cause that'll buy your seed guns
Now they spreading magazines 'fore they can read one
My glass jar's had a hell of a weed run. 
As we proceed son, and I know
Every hood got a street fam if not they need one
I thinking short-range, give me a sport range
I wanna get warmer; I'm jumping in the sauna
Duck when I'm passing by
Put your head between your legs; kiss your ass goodbye, braah
You niggas lost y'all game; I'm throwing the Roc down
Just to put y'all D, I'm back on the block now 
Running your mouth, 'fore I shit all in it
All y'all ass, and I'm about to dig all in it 
I birthed you niggas, I fed and I burped you niggas 
Quick as that, I will Earth you niggas
Clothed you niggas, wiped the snot from the nose of you niggas
What not to expose you niggas
Fist, knife, or razor fight
I got a year and a day, still played it like they gave me life
Can't walk through the jail without shackles and two cops 
Throwing shit on the warden outta the food slot 
Got connect with pop, he boofin' the weed plants 
Get my khakis washed and pressed for a few stamps
Respect in the jail, a check in the mail
I stay on the phone, I don't put collect on the bill 
Ay, you better know I'm going all-out, whatever the cost
So fuck whoever hating, I'm the king of the South
You gon' forever see me flossed, Spyder with the top off
Third gear I got lost to the million dollar law
J.G. the one who told the bitch to take your tops off
I'm a seven-figure nigga, paid the cost to be the boss
On the streets or behind the wall
Lift weights, get straight, 'til it's time to ball
Even if I never sell a million times at all
Dope boy trap niggas, I'll grind for y'all
Pimp Squad, D-Block I'll ride for y'all
A-Town to Y.O, see the Chevy ride slow
With the light turned down and the beat down low
40-cal's and K's out the window
You better do like Lil' Jon told you "Get Low"
Cause you can cancel Christmas, when the chopper-missle hit you
I ain't waiting for permission; I'm a flip until it hits you-Vaya
-Come on
-Vaya
-A vailar
Where're my niggas with the big dicks? -Ahh
Where're my niggas with the hot whips? -Ahh
Where're my niggas living better?
We want Barettas and Amarettas, butter leathers and mad cheddar
We play the front not the back, when there's beef I attack
Grab the guns and start lighting
Ya'll the bitch niggas behind cars scared to death like "yo, who fighting?"
How the fuck you teaching me I ain't got no obedience
Ya'll are made of shit I'm the thug's ingredients
And for my niggas I peel like fucked up paint jobs
Cover your block and put holes in you like old blankets
Fuck a bitch use a sock and wipe my nut what?
Run in your spot and use a Glock to get my cut what?
Smack you in public and embarrass you slut what?
Put you on punishment the same way I do to my son
And the only bullets by my stomach be the clip from my gun
And when my gun busts it's over so close the curtains
My silencer's like ch, ch, ch like birds was chirping
I like Boricuas ya know that Sheik be freaky
I put coke in their peepee then stuff the bras
Put some coke in the bras that look like coconuts
That's what's up don't have Sheik's click clack this up
Disload the back pack her bitch ass back me up
You know double R and Terror Squad niggas want they cut
I'm well know like Al Capone, full blown like Tone Montana
In the zone sitting on chrome stoned sipping on Champana
Rolling ganja up in Bible paper
A high that will take us through the eyes of Christ, John, Elijah, Jacob
I make the kind of green that hustler's dream
Busting out that custard cream
Piper cause I'm piped up with the mustard team
Plus the queen Fort Knox and hearts
King of medallions Monty Guard
Even Italians see my battalion prop the broad
I got the squad over qualified pulling over Karl Kani
Range Rover tilted three wilted hydraulic slide
Spark the Live in the crowd ripping trough housings
Like the Wu do in Shaolin
John Blazing on a pound of buddha and all the mami chulas
They want to ride on my Honda scooter
You know the red one from the video
But really though she ain't coming and she ain't running the
Trizzie yo!
Disrespect the Don word's bond I'm gonna shoot ya
We can get it on maricon hijo'de gran puta
Who you fucking' wit?
Bitch ass nigga you ain't running' up on shit
Talking' like you gonna bust yo clip
Nigga you ain't no fucking threat
You talk a lot but you ain't never realized that if you walk that block
Cock that Glock, think I'm pussy oh shit man!
Big Punisher's off his rocker
What you got? Beef wit' me? Aight then papi, Sheik's with me
Thought you cats were gonna creep on me
Without some type of an injury
I see coward in yours, what you up in my eyes?
Big dick between mine, What the fuck between your thighs?
Pussy, If I shoot, are you gonna shoot back?
I don't think so, your man's the thug you ride piggy-back
You're the one that passed the gat, told your man to bust that
You ain't making no money, you're a broke-ass cat
And once these pop, cops bring the chalk
And the mop to get the rest of you off the sidewalk. what!Ayo back off the boat, unload the dope
Untie the rope, this is not soap
Get it out the water, complete my order
Get it down to florida, Sheek's so smarter
Before only count to ten like a kindergarder
I got no patience, I don't like waitin'
See my homie in the rear, say hello to Satan
I'm that blatant, y'all can keep hatin'
Cuz I'll take a bitch out without datin'
You know what I'm skilled in
Keep the guns and the coke in the trump buildin'
Keep the deers and the raccoon arround my children
Give'm fresh air, kinda mad but the school system best there
And I'm still a thug keep the white tee
Over the banana incase one of these gorillas bug
D-Block Dipset get ya shit plugged

Down in Miami puttin miles on the Rosta
Feds got mommy's child on the posta
But I ain't gon' snitch, not on my Cosa Nostra

Until the day I get nailed, I ain't givin' a fuck
You gotta find me guilty. New York's most wanted

If nothin' else at least I know my dreams is reachable
People say I changed but I think I'm the same brother
DB 9 and the Vanquish is the same colour
Potato salad white, them haters gotta fight
The scrilla is on stash  the weight is outta sight
Dope money to rap money, still on the same route
I ain't miss a game since T-Bo came out
Way under the radar, stay offroad

Got connects with pop, he boofin' the weed plants
Get my cackies washed, I'm pressed for the food stamps
Respected in the jail, a check in the mail
I stay on the phone, I don't put collect on the bill
You let them DC niggas have secks in your cell
You live with a gun, you like gettin' hit from the front
You stay on some ish like two !!s with no chick
Rumor has it you like your chicks with no !!

Take 'em home, fuck a couple racks 
That's game twenty thousand on the ground 
Anybody make a move, I swear to god

Fifty thousand on my Rollie, hoe 
Rose gold on that Audemar

My gun is my life or my secret weapon
Going down
King Push
Meet Katia and Nadia  
My nine millimeter mafia 
You ain't know a nigga speak Russian?  
I'm bilingual when these hoes bustin'
My nigga forty with a tool habit 
No nose bone from his two habit
Whole hood call him mood ring
Coke habits turn 'em savage, on a mood swing
Benz truck with the Poltergeist
Shit parks itself,  my less sober nights
With TVs for my godchildren
Watching Devil's Advocate, now they god fearing
It's King Push with the Sheek Louch
That's cocaine royalty with deep roots
It's King Push with the Sheek Louch
Cocaine royalty, deep roots
Gun is my life or my secret weapon

Going down
Bang bang
Bang bang
Bang bangJump out the Rover, nigga
Hoodie on, back to carrying them things
Summer’s over nigga
I clapped my shit
Just copped a GT, album about to drop
I’m about to wrap my shit
They gon' see me way upstate
Sheek Louch: After Taxes
G-Unot on the plate
The crack is beige, the wine is aged
The yak is strong, the barrel is long
Sheek show these little niggas ass like thongs
I ain’t spit that shit to get this whip
Your advance, I made that with just this trip
Next trip I’m saving my dough
I already know the hip-hop police sit and study my flow
So I throw them off, play the golf course
Disappear like ants
Yellow four wit the Polo plaid pants
And ever since New Orleans
I’ve been coming through Queens
Copping weed and crazy blunts
Word is,
Curtis Ratson,
they ain’t seen you once
Diamond up, back with Bad Boy reminiscing
Me and Big both Bacardi Lime it up
They say I’m too sick for the new school
I can’t attend classes, so I just build up the masses
Red Monkey Jeans, Belushi glasses
Me just sitting there, cause some crashes
Sheek a rare breed
They don’t understand what I’m doing there
With some sunflower seeds
10-10'ing, army coat no linen
Doo rag, but not from my head, the beat’s spinning
They say I'm what the street’s been missing
Dropped "Walk Wit Me", but that was just for the streets to listen
November 8th, I’m coming back like the wrath?
Bitch niggas ya’ll ain’t safe
LETS GO!
You could see the pictures I paint son
If I ain’t the King of New York then there ain’t one
Tell me who fucking want it
And you can put something on it
I’m in the O-6 supercharged with nothing on it
Mad hot, to have is to have not
My crack spot is Protools on my laptop
Much cheaper then The Carter, it’s affordable
And I ain’t never gotta infiltrate it, cause it’s portable
The trey 5-7 is chrome
If any big niggas is with me they just came home
Either way, I’m a pop that nine
Call him 40 Cent now, cause he dropped that dime
And he got me kinda jammed up right now, I can’t lie
But I don’t know who told his black ass he can’t die
The other day I made 40 in a hour
Fuck, in the studio, I’m Berry Gordy with the powder
No retreat , No surrender
I’m at the juice bar, Armageddon’s in the blender
Getting ready for the winter
Sweatsuit weather, some reason I shoot better
Carry the big gats And leave the scene real fucking nasty
Like chocolate milk after a Big Mac
I’m on my CEO shit right now
Until this underhanded politic shit pipe down
Shout out to the media and masses
November 8th, Sheek Louch: After Taxes
One{Sheek} 
Yo I mean, you been there for me
You know what I'm sayin, and ya know
And I won't do you wrong ever again, nah mean, and you just, you been there
And I'mma be there for you from now on, you know what I mean
I ain't gonna neglect you, I ain't gonna do none of that shit
You got my full undivided attention, and you know what I'm sayin
And I'm not afraid to say it, I love you, I love you, I love her, fuck it, I love her
Haha
Uh huh

Ha, I ain't afraid to say it, uh uh, I'mma thug, 
More than that, I'mma man, ya know what I mean 
I'm in love, you my bitch, my bitch 
Let's go
Uh
I used to dream about you watchin every move you made 
I was young though, I think third or second grade 
I'd go home, write a poem, put it right to a beat
What I would do, what I would say if we would one day meet
Started getting older, still lovin your style
How you dressed, how you drove the whole 80's wild
I was proud when you first got on MTV 
You was in the video chillin with Run-DMC
That's my girl 
Little nigga fiendin to hit it
Knowin one day in the future I'd be right up in it
Started doin talent shows, I had it off the hook
You was there but you was too big, you wouldn't even look
I ain't mad you ain't noticed til I got with a group
But even then it wasn't nothin 'less I got in the coupe 
Got me goin crazy, every day you switch up on me
Puttin that in my face knowin me so horny
C'mon
{Styles P}
You all I got 
You all I want 
You all I need 
From day 1 
Till my death bed 
You all I breathe 
I'm disciplined 
I'm dedicated 
And determined too 
You got your ups and downs 
But I don't really mind 
I still ride wit you still ride
{Sheek}
Ok, listen
The group doin good , still in the hood 
Got a nickname Sheek now you startin to speak 
Said you wanna fuck wit all three if that's ok 
I'm like cool, once I hit it it was that anyway
A couple years gone passed, still havin a ball
A million times got the pictures hangin on my wall
When I first hit it, I was like Sheek the man 
I stopped givin you the attention I originally planned
Then you stopped fuckin wit me 
And left me alone
And people only seen you with Jada and P 
You even went around town and started doggin me bad 
But it was my fault ya know, I couldn't even get mad 
Had to grab the pen and pad and get right back
Write some more poems to your ass and get back on track 
I ain't go no problems telling you I love you to death
And that I'm whipped
And my shit'll be blown if you skip
Let's go
A'yo I had to hit the streets, they said you be out there a lot
And I can find you around any nigga out that's hot
Every club, every whip, every gambling spot
You know you'd rather be with me, you like to bug out
Love to bring the thug out
Plus I be keeping it tight
We even go to work together, let you play all night
Mad loud while I sit and I write
Haha
We gon' see the world together
But not on cable
All your friends lovin me, you even got me a label
Got the magazines lovin our relations
People love to hear us talk, DJ's record our conversations
You good around other people, 'specially kids
You make them happy, even brothers doin their bids
And I ain't jealous at all , go out and spread your wings
And you can hang with Pop, just pick up the phone when it rings
Let's go
I ain't gon' lie to y'all, I'm whipped D-Block, D-Block, D-Block, D-Block
D-Block, D-Block, D-Block, D-Block
D-Block, D-Block, D-Block, D-Block
Ohh, shit, let's go
 2x
You can kiss your ass goodbye
D-Block, D-Block, D-Block, D-Block
La da da, da da da
D-Block, D-Block, D-Block, D-Block
Aiyyo, this that shit that make niggas wanna rep they clique
Grab their gun an' diss niggas to their dick
Buck somethin', go somewhere an' fuck somethin'
Like that frontin' nigga bitch, make her suck somethin'
Wild out, D-Block shirt inside out
Hoodie on with the all black Belushis on
Niggas yappin' 'til they muh'fuckin' face is torn
Tongue is gone, three-piece suits is worn
Hit y'all fagot ass niggas that's scared to death
Talk shit, when I'm around, y'all hold y'all breath
I make murder music, my shit bang in the city
But they want me to chill since Janet showed titty
It's too much violence now since Ja ruined 50
I don't know no other way but to rap gritty
Fuck that, baby, when I'm rich
Until then where the fuck is my thugs at up in this bitch? 
 2x
You can kiss your ass goodbye
D-Block, D-Block, D-Block, D-Block
La da da, da da da
D-Block, D-Block, D-Block, D-Block
Whaddup, nigga? You cut up, nigga
Shoot shit to lift the truck up, nigga
D-Block, D-Block howl like a wolf
Tell your mom I throw a child off the roof
Give a basshead a hundred dollars to towel off the Coupe
Style on niggas; beat somethin' down
We gon' pile on niggas, wild on niggas
That's a lullaby for you
Better ask your man, he ready to die for you
We comin' through, tearin' the block up
We ain't gettin' locked up, that mean we even shootin' the cops up
Whaddup? Yeah nigga, two mo' times
Whaddup, whaddup? Now we in the New York grind
Better kiss that ass goodbye, when I'm passin' by
With plastic nine to blast your eye, right, 
 2x
You can kiss your ass goodbye
D-Block, D-Block, D-Block, D-Block
La da da, da da da
D-Block, D-Block, D-Block, D-Block
Ayo, I talk shit how I wanna talk, bop how I wanna walk
An' you can tell that nigga dere is from New York
An' I still got my South niggas ready to squeeze
I don't need cake to see me with a couple of G's
An' I don't need a loan, muh'fucker, I'm grown
Had a thirty eight before I had a phone
I stuck niggas up before y'all lil' niggas started to bone
This that Sheek Louch shit, y'all niggas tryin' to clone
Let's be real, the average muh'fucker with a deal
Probably never had a fight, no guns, none of that
Niggas know I'm right, I say goodnight to my son
Give my baby moms a lil' cake
An' my moms a lil' somethin' 'fore I go on the run
Before pussy niggas try their hand
I'll kick in the door like, "Daddy's home"
An' I ain't 'Making The Band'
What y'all coward niggas don't understand? 
 2x
You can kiss your ass goodbye
D-Block, D-Block, D-Block, D-Block
La da da, da da da
D-Block, D-Block, D-Block, D-BlockI don't know
Maybe we can make a change, maybe not
I'm tired of crying, I'm tired of living
I'm tired of niggas, I'm tired of women
Just wanna be myself
Keep the fame, keep the wealth, give me my health
Take me to a place where they a'int hating no more
Where I don't gotta raise the hammer and clap the four
Where I don't gotta kick your door and ask for more
Where I don't gotta dig your floor and ask for more, whoa
Where I don't gotta serve no heads, cook no coke
And there's no such thing as feds
And there's no such thing as AIDS
And little kids live the age to walk the stage
No little babies crying, mama a'int dying
Papa live at home, he got a steady job
Everybody fall, he don't gotta rob
Walk with me talk with me
Some times I just sit and think
You know it's hard to express it y'all
That's why I put it all in ink
Where we ain't black or white
Matter fact we are, but we don't have to fight, or kill
Maybe Malcom would have been alive still
Maybe Martin would have been able to chill
Maybe a black face on a dollar bill
I keep hope alive, that I stay alive
I think it's coming, I try not to drink and drive
A place where the death penalty is gone
No abortions, life only lives on
Nobody getting shot for their chains
And no hard labor jobs, we all using our brains
And you don't have to strip through school
Cover your body mama, everything is cool
Let you daughter know here moms is smart
And that's your heart, before you tear her apart
I think I'm asking for too much man
No murders on the 5 o'clock news
No bodies over Jordan tennis shoes
Nobody laying on me, waiting to blast
I feel the spirits of my niggas that past
It's like they right here, I just can't see them
Sometimes I'm jealous of them, damn I wanna be them
Everybody fake, when will this ever end
If you don't know your enemy, the you don't know your friend
A place where there's no more wars, no more tears, no more liquor, no more beers
No more stocks, no more shares, no more fights, no more jails, no more kites
A place where you don't value money, just the air you breathe
And every day is sunny
I know it can never happen and it's just rappin
And I'm dreamin, againStyles: Yeah
Sheek: Uh Huh, D Block
Styles: D Block, You with me Louch?
Sheek: You know it my nigga
Styles: Yeah I know
Sheek: Yeah
Styles: You know why we do this right?
Sheek: Why's that dog?
Styles: Make these niggas feel us all the time, everytime
Sheek: Walk wit us
Styles: Are we the best or what?
Sheek: Who the fuck else
Verse 1
Styles P
Yo, we do nuthin', we are nuthin' 
I ain't pullin' my blade if I won't scar nuthin'
I ain't pullin' my gun if I won't shoot shit, that's useless 
I'll kill ya whole family, that's ruthless 
You could die nigga
I ain't droppin a tear, I ain't thinkin twice nigga, you ain't my nigga
I don't smoke with you, drink with you, eat with you 
I got a problem with you, I'mma let the heat whistle
This is real shit, nigga I peel shit 
I'm harder than concrete and steel mixed 
I wanna kill niggas 
You think it's part of the verse, it's part of the curse, and I don't really
Feel niggas 
They say stop the viloence, but I gotta join in it 
I'm in the hooptie with 3 Ki's a boy in it
This is pay day, fuck what they say 
D Block, grab your handguns and A-K's
Chorus 2x:
Bang that shit off, clap that kid up
Stomp that kid out, don't let him get up
Any block frontin', gon' wet that shit up
It don't mean nuthin' to me!
J Hood: Yeah! What up! D Block!
Verse 2
J Hood
Yo yo, ayo, ayo yo
Yo its the baby faced gangster, product of my enviornment
Hoodied up, stickin your grandfather for his retirement 
Talkin super hard when I know that you bitch-made 
Stab ya ass in the espohigus with a switchblade
Take it out and straight saw off your ribcage 
Pour gasoline on the matress where your kids lay
J Hood, D Block, respect the name and the click 
Whoever ain't feelin' this song could suck my dick
Garbage bag around your brother head, smother him out
To make sure he don't survive, nigga, I'm snubbin him out 
Make you drink a bottle of Chlorox, hit you with four shots
They can't determine the cause of your death in your autops'
You scared? Don't come outside, the streets is serious 
My ribs touchin, I'm starvin', trigger happy, and furious
We could do it whenever, wherever, nigga set a date 
Remember to ask the doc if he could replace your face 
Chorus 2x
Jadakiss: Uh huh, yeah, what, haha! Yeah, uh huh, yeah, uh, yeah
Verse 3
Jadakiss
Ayo, kill one of mine, I'mma kill one of yours 
It ain't bitin' for base, but they still want it raw 
Y'all niggas think y'all do dirt, we do it more 
My man turned 14 shirts into a store 
Now you could get it from us, we got enough of it 
The dead president dope Chris Tucker was fuckin' with
There's 2 things, ether the jail or the cemetary 
Hammers and the Hawks is on the itinorary 
Anywhere, any block, clap any iron 
And beat niggas 'till you can't identify em'
D Block my nigga 
To the niggas on cure perscription and Ki-lock my nigga 
What, it don't mean nuthin' 
And you got the rights to bang a nigga wherever you want if he frontin' 
We done starved together and burned some scriller
Now we doin' it again, it's your turn gorilla 
Chorus 2x
Verse 4
Sheek
Uh, you want it with who? 
You can't be talkin' to Louch or none of his crew 
We poppin' you quick 
Put big knives in you, bitch, get off our dick 
White Air's and white T's get filthy quick
And we ain't caughin' or sneezin', but the camp is sick 
Uh, stop frontin', y'all don't wanna pull triggers 
Lifetime, Sex In the City ass niggas 
Spit it for the hood and the gritty ass niggas 
Put big scars on the pretty ass niggas 
I'll pull up wit a hooptie at a black tie affair
And smack the fuck out a boozie nigga like a bear 
Crime don't pay, who the fuck said that? 
How much you think I'm gettin' for his chain, where my gat?
Nigga act up, I'll let it rip in his back 
You know who it is from coast to coast 
Thug niggas keep clappin' ya toast
What up!?
Chorus 2xI think it's time I start feelin bitchy
I've been too nice, too muthafuckin long
Yeah, it's definately time I get nasty
Yeah, yo, well if I can't talk lets square off in the streets like the westerns
Ten paces, turn around and squeeze at unfamiliar faces
First y'all industry niggas shut the fuck up
Swear you know a nigga's shit by readin the Vibe
What some faggit-ass reporter done wrote on your life
I stop the presses, don't let this be your last interview you do
I say it straight, print it straight to avoid this bullet wound boo
And y'all niggas kill me with that Windy Williams shit
See a playa bummy swear a nigga Puff jerkin niggas money
Something ain't right, them niggas ain't got no whips
Where they rolley's at, but fuck y'all we got more chips
Shit y'all doin nothin, I can buy a  for a bitch
Now let me see what else, oh yeah these hoes act like we married
We ain't engaged, don't be mad if I don't take you backstage
Yo, if I hit that I hit that, why don't you leave it at that
Instead you try to star sixty-nine my bitches on jacks
That's why you get smacked, cause y'all hoes ain't never gon' learn
That's why many of these younger brothers don't go on that turn
As for y'all MC's,
whoever write your rhymes
Might as well hold your microphone
, thats how I feel if it ain't your own
What we spit is individually writ
Why you paid sixteen stars to write your sixteen bars
Bought like sixteen cars and ain't like none of them yours
Y'all niggas lucked up and made it through these doors, shut the fuck up
Shut the fuck up
Yo, yo, yo, aiyyo I pump up, get big walk through the party jig
Hat back, tattoos that straight to the bar kid
No weed, healthy as an ox the big man from Lox
You see solo in some spots, no crew just blocks
The freaky one, mom said I was soon to be done
Because I sexed more, and my career's yet to begun
But I can't help that, you bless me with they looks and pops with the yanks
So now the dimes gimme brain, and spot me faster in his hand
Sheek baby, my style been rough until Puff showed me the better things in life
And how to live phat like Biggie, so I present my shit like that
Half rough half jiggy, this part time college nigga, part time job
Had to taste the cake one time and decided to rob, and buy drugs
Caught slippin almost got Sheek plugged, Jack Daniel, dog
Shorty rushed the buildin with the pump out, he spit around I'm like, whoa!
I guess it was God that pushed my head down, cause I ain't know
, word yo
And since then neither religious or christian, but I keep the faith in Him
Plus the desert eagle clan, so if niggas click they know by now they better
, wha
Shut the fuck up
Yo, aiyyo, my whole click been ConAir, everytime we fly
but we don't jack shit
We play it cool when in doubt no cash, plastic, gats plastic
Now thats sweet, unditected, so when I walk through the scanners it don't beep
I hear fuck Sheek, fuck the Lox, Styles, and Jay, so what they signed to Bad
Boy
Puff jerkin them anyway, but the difference is if I'm gettin jerked I'm still
Seein noise
Push the big boy toys that fly by like zooms
So I sit and  like a bitch, Lox in Cancun
Up in daddios fuckin wild hoes, the groupy chicas
So fuck y'all, we paid y'all , we train hard continuously, cause we
Smart
How Rocky ran up them stairs, we run up charts
and won't stop til one of us
Depart
With one through the heart, but even then that won't stop us
Cause or spirit gon' guide us, till we rich and old, hand worn down from
Arthritis
In the hall of fame, we killed this game in your website like spiders
Old and gray we're still the same Lox you can't divide us, wha
Shut the fuck up]
Imma make the hits

Aiyyo, whos that looking through my window
Blaaaow, y'all muh'fuckas know my style

Louie bat to his head, roll a truck in his ass
Old man style, bust a bottle, cut 'em wit glass
Yeeeeeah!, it can be who? Sheek the mc
Spit hard, the mc, in the yard, the mc
I eat dictionaries and spit out little pieces of paper
Thats why my vocabulary sick
Use big words like, suck-my-dick
You dont wanna play Louch, wit out entering cheats
I'm like Eddie Kane nigga from the Five Heart Beats
Coke thicker than ya muh'fucking cream of wheats
Paper too small nowadays, I write on sheets
And I done made so many hits, I'm about to cop cleats
Without baking soda still keep the arm and hammer
D block flag waving on the rangest tanner
In our jungle, all gorillas keep a banana
Spraying dumb, yo heat is old as nana
Listen, if you wit us no time for bailing
Sheek Louch, D-block, stop Rose like jalen
No bull, nickle plate catch me pailing
Scoop big niggas, put 'em through half the sailing
Yeah! I dont care if I sell or not
The boy is hot, that be wit a oven glove
Fuck mainstream, keep me wit gangstah love
Street shit, Sheek shit, bring life to tug
Ha ha, I'm like new, but I been here tho
Just low, I ain't drop and y'all wanting a show
Book it, let the hood in and let me rock
Bring the hardest niggas from ya block, what up!

Step out, shopping boxes, Lemon Coronna
Scratching my ass, hoping that the kids tresspass
One of 'em vietnam niggas, my stitch wit hair triggers
I'm hot like, bout to start breaking you up
I feel the earths a little baller niggas shaking me up
I'm bout to dig inside ya pockets, start caking me up
I get coke before, I ever be outside wit a cup
And yo what, thats right, the god sick wit it
May be before, but right now the kid Louch forget it
I'm the best out right now, spread the news
I could write a book, Louch the new Langston Hughes
Yellow Play Boy nigga, stin Pepe Lepues
I dont just clap, Sheek'll make the 4 go off
Espionage and all that, like ????

Only thing, damn yo, I'm down to my last dutch
Think we got a problem, but really it ain't dough
There's one of me, and these bitches I count about three four
Think we got a problem, the homie just all talk

Black on black Aston the 21 strapped in
Dominican chick ridin' shotty all strapped in
Customize the dash on my shotgun strapped in
Cops on the shoulder, gotta pull a Hova
Time to fade to black
'cause I ain't pullin' over
The engine is a problem, that ain't no question
Pop the trunk, see the speakers kickin' like Beckham
Think we got a problem, Sheek know I'm hot
Kiss and Styles should make me a member of The Lox
I take all the beats, I remember how to box
If I ever get knocked out, I remember how to pop
Remember how to load everything inside my Glock
Ask the niggas in the hood 'cause they remember who I shot
Think we got a problem, I snitched on myself
And I hate rats, so I dug a ditch for myself, what

Well it's the king of the trill, Bun B'der, you know the name
And the streets is like the NBA, I love this game
Keep a bottle of Hennessey, a blunt and that purp
With my hand up on my heater, and my killas on churp
You see me one deep in the spot, think I'm slippin', try ya luck
'Cause I got sixteen homies with me that stay ready to buck
You can duck, dodge or dive, but it won't do diddly skwat
But leave ya with a leaky liver and both ya kidneys shot
But you may not pimpin', I ain't finna ask for it
My money, my hood or my respect, I'ma blast for it
You can't push fast forward, rewind or pause
I'ma beat you 'til you shittin' ya draws, so call the laws 'cause

I'm in the coop knockin to Luther the power of love {Ha}
Nigga you can feel the heat for yourself {uh huh}
And you can hate all you want
But the music gonna speak for itself, What
{Gun Shots} Hold fire, Hold fire
Started running, Starting retreating
Fuck it fire again
Leave niggas broken up, ox 'em down, wait for them to yell
And see they skin open up
{Whoo}
A nice guy but im evil and I hurt you

Anybody that you ever seen me would of merked you {uh huh}

After doing it in the yard up north, BitchL-O-X, getting stronger
D-Block, getting stronger
Hip Hop, getting stronger
Geah, geah, geah, geah
Sheek Louch coming through waving the four-four
Nike boots, black hoody, tell me who want war
Coke on the glass table, some rock vodka
Dutchy rolled,
soaked in Cuervo golden
My swag is up, my bars is tight
The house, the bitches, the jewelry, the cars is right
The hammer's light, titanium
I put three in your cranium like pop, pop, pop
Then I stop
Ah-ha~!
It used to be five-hundred K in the closet
Now it's a couple Ms every time I deposit
Tell the young boys, it ain't really nothing, it's logic
Stack whatever you get and don't spend till you got it
On top of that, stay consistent with your product
Don't matter if it's just weed or if it's narcotics
Do time, you'll pulling off the lock in something exotic
Boss Don Dada, dance with the Devil
Never bought the bitch Prada, you ain't getting nada
Pale moonlight, I'm goon like in hiding
And the slug from a four-pound
Like some pretty pussy walls, I tear you all down
We all go to war now, L dot, O dot, X motherfucker
Bricks on the planes, trains, couple to the truckers
Shoot from anywhere like niggas in the Ruckus
Getting stronger, barrel longer, coupe shorter
Jar of that water, millennium flow
Camora times two, millennium ho
Tattooed up, diamond cross, Hip Hop's Randy Moss
Dump the whole clip and toss
Hottest group, let the beat loop and we bury you niggas
In your pocket like Kiss and Jigga's
Big money, big cars and big cigars, what up?
Hah-ha~!
Yo, comas, funerals, wheelchairs, paraplegics
Real life, so you gotta believe it
If you did have a goal, then you gotta achieve it
Cause your body stays here but your soul gotta leave it
Square feet, hot wheels, two-hundred bricks
One shot deal cause everybody dabble or pop pills
It's hard to top that, point-blank the god has got crack
We U-P-S body parts back
I don't get the newest Benz, I get the newest house or newest business
I learned that from a Jewish friend
I break bread with the Arabs but I'm African
So I got dope chilling in the gray cab
I can hit you with a hook, or a straight jab
Or I could cock it back and shoot you in your face hab
And you know I'm from Y-O nigga
Got every kind of charge, even a Y-O niggaYo you gotta hear the sixteen I just laid B.G
Oh word, that shit a hit, that shit sound crazy
Yo check the phone man, the phone was ringin before
Yo this the Ghost right here my nigga
Damn I missed my nigga call, check my messages

To erase this message press seven, to save it press nine
Styles: Pick up ya goddamn phone man, I keep tryin to call you
Jesus Christ boy, one
Yeah, D-Block
Styles P you wit me dog?
Hell yeah, let's get 'em, let's go
You get smacked with the hammer nigga play your position
Or rigamortis set in and you stay in in position
Nigga I'll hawk your ass, wanna fit in my shoes
And you cowards can't walk my path
I don't know nobody fuckin wit us
I ain't Jerome Bettis but if I hit you it's gon feel like "The Bus"
And you couldn't live this life and play this role
And like, never part with your gun and stay this cold
Yo we in the streets where it's nothin but love
I'm them leather shits, you the Michael Jackson glove
I'm in the hood cause I'm dedicated
If I was you I woulda never made it
I'm Holiday so I'm celebrated
We don't reminisce bitch ass, remember that
Styles verse is the only thing I'm bringin back
Tell the ghetto show discipline
I said Sheek gun Puerto Rican, bullets stay whistlin
Sheek and SP in and out, hard for the streets
Turn the bass up and try not to fuck up your seats
Rock that shit, every corner, knock that shit
Niggas try to front on us, cock that shit
I guess I'm gettin older
Cause everybody that I thought was hot go inside the garbage folder
And nigga I'm from D-Block, I'm on 3-5-4
I keep my heat cocked, and my blunt lit
The mack out, take a piece of your back out
Raise it to your cheek nigga, dare you to speak
Shit I got plenty guns
And thugs that'll give a nigga a hug and say they stab anyone
You ain't never seen a nigga jaw hangin from his face
Sausage shaped red shit hangin from his waist
Nigga I'm well connected
By the time you hear this I'll be in jail
But I probly got two cells connected
Yak in one hand, the other the lizm
And If I push you down and wet you it's not baptism
Bitch this is mafia
It won't stop til they put you in the dirt
With the flowers on top of ya
Sheek goin broke is not in the plans
I could sell gloves to a nigga with no hands
A lot of niggas screamin they wolf, but I'm feelin they sheep
I won't be happy til the niggas is sleep
I'll punch a niggas nose in, duckin and bustin
Cuttin and cussin, hold that you bitch ass nigga
And I could make the best die
Cut your throat open, pull your tongue through it
That's a fuckin neck tie
We turn bitch niggas skin maroon
Pump turn niggas voices like they hit a helium balloon
If Christ is comin it oughta be now, I swear to God
Cause all yall faggot niggas die according to Styles
What nigga you could get it for free
Put your money up, ain't nobody fuckin wit Louch and P
Yeah nigga that's what's up

So be it take let your boyfriend see it
US gangsta but all my guns be Soviet

Chain hanging out but I ain't talking about jewelry
Talking ammunition, bullets, big artillery
Put a hole in a big ass social security

He used to have a good head on his shoulders
But now the shit gone
D-Block bout to wake the game and get these bucks
It's for them niggas Dickie Dan throwin it up rocking Chucks
Like pimples motherfucker I'm all in your face
You like sneakers when them strings about to get laced
What you need chronic homeboy, we got all types
Fuck your bikes, Nigga I smoke more than exhaust pipes
You know those new 7-60's yeah I got 2
One platinum like my rhymes the other raspberry blue
When I'm riding on the track like a surf board
I'm on the block pitching what the fuck you think I got the word for
Walk with me motherfucker we taking over the streets
Let em warn all your peeps Hood coming at they street
Sheek a fucking crook
Stake your house out know what your momma cook
Fuck her with a broom
Fuck the movie when I'm there its a panic room
Niggas start to stutter, please don't cut my mother
I'm too fucking gutter clip on top of each other
2 twelve gages take you threw the stages
Bullets running low but yours been there for ages
Cob web niggas iced out slob like I'm on a fucking bob sled niggas
I'll talk to yall niggas I ain't trying to shout
Why fit in with Sheek was born to stand out
You'll get pretzeled up twist in half
Long shit with the black spots like a giraffe
Clear my path when the guy walking
How you try getting in the club I hope you jump in my coffin
Besides D-Block I don't see that often
 4xA'yo four shots let off, black truck sped off
Big shit, tryna take a motherfuckin head off
A'yo hold up man, let me take y'all back to the begining
Let y'all know what happend that night, listen
I don't even know these niggas hangin in front
Usually we woulda been asked them what do they want
What they came here for, this is 354
What you tryna get some gas or some shit from the store
But nobody asked these motherfuckers what do they want
It was bitin, mad traffic, the first of the month
It was me, Chep, Bizzy and Hit
B.G. and Lickalone and yeah I think Earth was there and shit
And a few other niggas in and out of the buildin
Tryin to catch every sell but not to children
Got a sixty of that yack in the store in the back
Chep about to go home and get more of his pack
Jake ain't fuckin wit us, what's the miracle
Niggas moms ex heads now turn spiritual
Wanna preach to us talk about Christ
And how fuck sand, how he could bring the beach to us
That's when I noticed niggas still outside
Hoody on with some shades like they tryna hide
So I cocked the hammer then I walked to 'em
No beef, just a friendly little talk to 'em
Listen
Sheek: Here we go, yo whaddup money?
Guy: Yo whaddup
S: What y'all niggas waitin for somebody or somethin?
G: Yeah, why?
S: Nah nah, I'm sayin y'all niggas got on big hoodies and shit

G: It's all love, it's all good
S: Aight, just checkin dog
A'yo, turns out these niggas is not from here
And they got blood on they hands while they drinkin a beer
They just robbed Dread and them niggas spot
I told 'em they gotta get up out of here, they makin it hot
That's when four shots let off, a black truck sped off
Big shit, tryna take a motherfuckin head off
Bombaclot, no man rob me spot, everybody here feelin me Glock
They done put us in a mix now we gotta go to war with
Dread and them niggas cause they think we wit these dicks
Shots goin everywhere, everybody clappin but them niggas that was standin there
They fuckin disappeared
I cut one yardy underneath his fuckin beard
Still clappin, got everybody runnin scared
They ain't backin down and we ain't bitchin
Niggas comin out the house with the hitchelin under the michelin
Throwin back a clip or two
You would think we went to war with
Colin Powells crew
Police comin now but we don't give a fuck
Rhas' tryna grab all his niggas in the truck
That's what I get for lettin niggas blend in
And they ain't really wit us, niggas really tryna get us
I keep my Glock not givin a fuck
But the bullshit is we still gotta watch for that truck
Yaknahmean, y'all niggas remember that night dog?
Only B.G. had his gun on him man, word up
Styles P had his gun on him
Besides that niggas was fuckin naked man

And silence those guns dog, we woulda been sick
Check it out though, I know them faggot ass niggas kid
You know what the fuck I'm talkin about
Niggas just bought them shits, that's why we had all them hammers
Besides that man, word up man, no wing niggas around us dog

Yo, I don't think you understand what I mean
When I aks you to Walk Witt Me, I got the hawk wit me
No talk wit me, in the yard wit my dickies 
Young but I remind you of somebody in the sixties
I knew it was on when our God was shown
But I was caught up in the mix of some glittery shit
A.T. him and Mase makin' mils wit it , I ain't mad
But that shit wasn't me , had to get up off that
Jewelry and Cristal, couldn't talk that
They my niggas though, I ain't mad, I ain't hatin'
To this day him and Busta got the best show 
Ya know I'm sayin' yo fuck yo yo yo, yo feel me though
Back wit my niggas, Double R
Before X blew it up, before Eve was a star
We are the streets, they couldn't wait for it
Interscope couldn't wait to get a plate for it
Grammy night, couldn't wait to get a date for it
Not, we sold over gold
Finally reached platinum status and near that is
Still in the hood, still tryin' to learn the biz
Jadakiss dropped a solo they lovin' his voice
I'm lovin' his shit but the hood thought it was moist
Styles P dropped Gangsta and a Gentleman
Hard, no need to speak but the promotion was weak
Sheek never had solo plans
Till I dropped a freestyle in the studio with some a my mans
Lobson tweaked that, Mario leaked that
Your shit hot you could bring the muhfuckin streets back
Nah, I dunno I'm just tryin' get a label
Sit behind the desk you know, watch a lil' cable
Put my lil' man out, throw a few grand out
Get into some pop music, put a rock band out
Got wit my nigga K, Kool and Whop
Green Lantern had my shit on the block 
Killed it in Flex now these labels tryin' to jump on our cock
If we could get Sheek album we'll sign D-Block
P and Kiss was like fuck that we gettin' you off
We up in there, the rest of these labels is soft
Mario had a meetin' or two
Brought us to the U-N-I-V-E-R-S-A-L, what up Sue?

Mom prayin' like, "Please, baby, get up" )
Niggas see your wounds, turn around and spit up
I ain't playin’, Donnie came to fuck shot up, shyeah
This is that raw shit, New York
Winter time in front of the store, shit
Burnin' my weed with a stashbox real close 
Ear to the street, my lyrics, you could feel a pulse 
Put your glass up, let's have a toast 
Twenty years in this game, me, Kiss, and Ghost 
We stay away from them corny rappers that do the most
Gangstas, our careers ain't even close 
Don't make me bust you, nigga
Grew up together but I don't trust you, nigga
You let your feelings out when you drunk
Beef come, you run and hide like a fuckin' punk, shyeah
Top of the mornin', gun in her mouth while your bitch breath stinkin' and yawnin'
I had to talk to my young boy before he get life
Watch these left niggas 'cause they ain't right
Word, that's the same shit that I was sayin'
Gotta watch these niggas how these niggas be anglin'
Make 'em see stars so I start banglin'
Abduct these cowards out like they got ganged in
I said fuck me, I feel the same then
Talk behind my back and when you see me, wanna make friends
Fake type dudes, no love, no loyalties
'Spect us when you see us, this hip-hop royalty 
The crown secure and I got a tip 
With the clips filled, the wrong word'll get you killed
Q.B. reppin', ain't a thing changed
Grown man, see y'all niggas out playin' kid games
Twenty-twenty comin', things realer than it ever been
People co-signin' shit y'all peddlin'?
Me and Sheek on a whole other wavelength
On point with it, let them fake nigga stay 
Don't make me bust you, nigga
Grew up together but I don't trust you, nigga
You let your feelings out when you drunk
Beef come, you run and hide like a fuckin' punk, shyeah
Top of the mornin', gun in her mouth while your bitch breath stinkin' and yawnin'
I had to talk to my young boy before he get life
Watch these left niggas 'cause they ain't right
Yeah, still keep guns in the panel
Shot him through his flannel out the pocket of my Louis camo
Niggas say what's up but can't stand you
We call 'em New York undercovers, them nigga's done been cancelled
You know me, a little Wraith, a hot bitch
Pharrell Chanel slides, I'm bumpin' that Pac shit
My daughter seen a squirrel, said, "Look, dad, a chinchilla"
Up in the Bronx, born killers, we been realer 
I catch a body like that nigga shotty
Run up in your lobby with the mini shotty, body everybody
Black turtleneck, black 
Had to get me on the tax, Joe Crack's the black Gotti
I pop shit 'cause they can't stop me
Who, him? He can't rob me
Your bitch a damn thotti
You know these raps, they be physical
You could feel it though

Don't make me bust you, nigga
Grew up together but I don't trust you, nigga
You let your feelings out when you drunk
Beef come, you run and hide like a fuckin' punk, shyeah
Top of the mornin', gun in her mouth while your bitch breath stinkin' and yawnin'
I had to talk to my young boy before he get life
Watch these left niggas 'cause they ain't rightYou ain't no hood nigga 
You understood nigga
You ain't no hood nigga
Barbecue chips and a butter roll it's good nigga
Let me see you roll one
Where you get that dutch from
When you had your last fight
Where you buy that, Shop Right?
Cause you ain't come in this store
Nigga with your glass jaw
Why you think you hardcore
You don't want this .44 pointed at your mug
Cause I'm wetted off a drug and that molly got me bug
And your chain is looking love
Ha
You ain't a hood nigga
What's good nigga
Chicken wings and fried rice is good nigga
I ain't turn bougie
I be in the hood drinking liquour in my Gucci
Real nigga's salute me ha
You ain't no hood nigga 
Bubblegum wrapper fronts manhunt that's my car
To gold fronts and a manhunt from clapping at pa
You ain't no hood nigga
We don't believe that
Now tap the bottom of this brown where that weed at
I bring the fiends back with that hard white lambing on the crate
On the block but the rocks in a magnet on the gate
Never catch me slipping I'm in slipper but whatever
The beretta's in the store I go to war in Chancletas
I'm a hood nigga
You get with house work
You ain't never come outside and when you did you took the outskirts
You let me ride your bike I had it the whole night and your moms forced you to fight
You ain't no hood nigga
You scared to leave your section
Relying on the police for protection
I don't know your kind of hood nigga
You got your face all mean rocking a girly boy top matching your spandex jeans
It's either good due or Gorilla, there's nothing in between in my hood nigga
Everything is what it seems
If your realest beef is on Twitter
It's fit for a Queen
Don't come outside with these killers get ripped at the seams
You ain't a hood nigga
I bet you curl up on the couch watching the lifetime network while twerking it out
It's like your chromosome get rattled when hood nigga's battle
We get loose and I ain't talking bout the booth
You ain't no hood nigga
Where your stripes at
Where your block bitch you ain't built like that
You ain't got no hood pass where you play your nights at
Say you keep that toolie on you nigga where your pipes at
Nigga's doing time bitches they don't give no kites back
Nigga's trying to look at some pussy where you Nikes at
Pork and beans and weiners Ramen noodles and a chopper hoe
Eight nigga's one rule: re-up in the locker hoe
Hoping we don't fuck it off
City try, block's dead everybody talking
You the main reason the block's scared
You ain't that gangster type nigga you just gangster type
All across the internet nigga that ain't gangster like
You ain't no hood nigga Guess whos coming to dinner.. mighty D–block
Guess whos coming to dinner.. mighty mighty D–Block
D-Block- oh-oh-oh-oh D- block
(louder, louder, yeh,
Don Don
)
Okay I lyrically ejaculate
I come on tracks go ‘head and hate
Go inside, run and hide
Coz this gon boost the murder rate
Flying with the long behind me
Nickel plate, extra shiny
Got this woman on my tip like they name is Tiny
Every hood, light is up, dark liquor, plastic cup
Sour diesel, hoodie on, gun out like what the fuck
Porsche turbo, yankee blue, Derek Jeter of his crew
Rosé, feet up, deuce deuce in my shoe
Ten years on radio, ten years on mixtapes
Did deals with everybody, even survived the Puff rape
Now I’m all bossed up, watch all glossed up
D block, we hard in the streets, put your signs up
Money ain't shit to me, respect means more to me
We define loyalty
This is rap royalty
Let the fo five off, live for, die for
Hustle is my first love, and the streets my side ho
Haze then im back to sour
Okay im back in power
Business man nine to five, hooligan after hours
Ain't nobody to compare to what we contribute
The bars is like the possession, with intent to distribute
My hand, wrist, ears and neck laid
Nothing but straight fire for a decade
Im in the polo rounds, polo down
Feelin like when Tony put Manolo down
Ya all know who control the town
This is for my Looters and shooters
With them deserts, and rugars and lugers
Who was newest to beat, talk to us, huh?
I got ‘em don don, fully black armani yan
Mi not play wit dem facey boys, shut it down
Keep my barrel spinnin, thats why ratty warm
Have you marked for death, you’re whole family gone
Got em pounds of thatgreen we call it the Hawks
D- Block, one time, we call it new york
Get money, hit honeys on the regular
Bully stay in peoples ear like a cellular
Now the World and your girl they all know my name
Got em Trey Songing, Bullys insane
Never been to Yonkers before neither enterpreneur
And im a monster for sure
Like Godzilla
Shoot is on your death,
cut ya deck like a card dealer
Puffin on the lies, spent a buck at the car dealer
They tryna say d block is negative
Any rapper breathing is breathing cause we let em live
I can tell you why these soft suckas mad at me
They can see I got every kind of flags with me
Honor flags,? flags, game flags
Its a d block, everywhere we bangs at
Money long, run long, bullets long
Word to your hood, if you got a hood, put it onI don’t know what they…
I don’t know what’s on they mind
I know what I’m thinking about
Yo, I be thinking bout my money, yep bout my wealth
How I be drinkin' you be thinkin’ I don’t care about my health
But I’m lightin’ and I’m smokin'
I got like 50 on my wrist and I ain’t jokin’
Shooters on deck, and they ready
Mack 11, 9 milli, automatie
And we pull up in them cars, and we skirtin'
Try to act like she don’t notice, it’s working
Dumb dumb bitch, It ain’t hard to tell
I’m tryna upgrade you, put you in Chanel
Or we can hit the hood and hit the local hotel
And hit it from behind until that pussy swell
Well, woo, more dutches
More 'gnac, more weed, more dutches
We hold each other up like crutches
D- Block, you know them niggas can’t touch us
What’s on your mind? Huh?
She a bad motherfucker, swear to God I love her
She always catch a seizure every time that I fuck her
And it’s straight to the hole like I’m ballin’ in the Rucker
Marty tryna peak, who that? That my brother
Sipping on the Henny got me up, so horny
I'mma fuck her till the sun up
Aw, put the ding a ling all up in her tummy
I’mma fuck her till she throw up, I ain't lyin'
I’m the realest, you could put it on my life
She gon’ make you disappear, yea she did it to the Sprite
She ain’t never have a nigga like me ever in her life
That’s why she on the wood like a fucking parasite
Ooh, I love the way she lick me, don’t leave a hickie
My girl finna forgive me, and I don't wanna risk it!
It ain’t nothing but a word
Gun cocked for my nigga Ferg
A$AP, fuck what a nigga heard
And we don’t miss, we just plead the 5th
In any courtroom, ain’t that right Kiss? Huh?
Guilty till I’m innocent
Came straight from the bottom of the tenements
I don’t leave the block dog till I finish it
I don’t fuck with it if I can’t benefit
I can count, read and got good penmanship
If I started out with it, I'mma end with it
I'mma figure out a way to try to blend with it
Shit y'all just now doin', we been did it
I ain’t talkin’ to ball players or rap niggas
I’m thinkin' a little further then that nigga
Yeah, from brick movers to pack niggas, fuck rap nigga
Now tell me, what’s on your mind?Pain 
Pain 
Pain 
The pain that a man has to endure
When two junior flip, hotrod-lovin', pig policemen
 put him in a position where he must choose
Against humiliation as a man or death
 leave your head, 'cause you outta be dead
[Verse 1: Sheek Louch &
Jadakiss
]
Block-a, this is your brain on drugs
Love is pain and pain is love
Block-a, this your brain on drugs
Ya'll came with police, we came with thugs, uh
Ayo, I dropped pain on 'em, switched the game on 'em
Whoever out there hot, I'ma rain on 'em
I see niggas slowin' down, I'ma gain on 'em
No beef but fuck it, put his brain on 'em
Uh, left faces hurtin'
I'm in Yonkers, comin' down Burton in that thing with the curtain
Pants leg up, call me Sheek Cool J
Hat low, shorty from a Paris runway
The thing is loaded
Eatin' lunch with politicians and I don't even think I voted
They see my face, they think I'm rich 
I'm by myself, they think I'm bitch 
Until they layin, while doctors stitch 
'Cause I clap like a nasty bitch 
You don't know me 
You know my name, you heard my raps
But you don't feel my
[Chorus: Sheek Louch &
Jadakiss

Yeah, yeah
Uh, sort of like an evangelist
'Cause you hear it but you don't know how to handle this
Uh, be it the nine or the knife
Everybody felt it at sometime in they life
It's all different kinds to endure
Pain is pure and most times it ain't no cure
That's why I'm in the hood, I don't be where the stars is
One of my records is platinum but all of my cars is
You pokin' no Mount Air-y lodges
I'm Germany, tall bust ménages,
Trading Place
If you don't like the hand you was dealt
Just make sure you save your aces
Uh, and I'm gettin' a lil dividends
Big Boys think I'm distributin'
Divin' off yachts in the Carribean
Yeah, thats just the life that we livin' in

Ayo, I'm ridin' dirty
On the passenger side with just the permit, me and my birdy
Louis boots, Red Monkey jeans on
Jamaica chick get my sex in Queens on
Haze lit, blunt look finger-thick
Flow make 'em all fight like a springer chick
Sheek Louch and Jada-the-Mwa
Put them half dollar hoes on the side of your car
Don't never put your eye in the way
Dream like you livin' forever but live like you dyin' today
Uh, 38 is new, the 357 is a lil older
Everything else is for the shoulder
From here on, I spit it in rare form
Bruh, these niggas is either in the ground or airborne
And you just runnin' your mouth, stay in your house
If you don't know nothin' about no

What's your name again? Donnie G 
Who else witchu fam?  
Wave the ruger at these haters
This New York Rap who else witchu?
Don Don .38 revolver in a brown bag
Money in the pocket when I walk my pants sag
In and out of town that's why the God look jet lag
Sheek still bangin' and I ain't wavin' a red flag
The curse of Bin Laden, boats dont float across
His ghostly bones said rise up with green moss 
Uh, Smoke blowin' on a weave
Audie on the sleeve, Louis Vs in the breeze 
Condos in Miami I ain't even use the keys
Women and fast cars, some of my pet peeves 
Cash and big guns be with them OGs
Levis, white ups, city lab tees
Knicks ain't make it, Yanks gotta bring it home 
The Dirty Harry sittin on me all chrome
Public Enemy, welcome to the terrordome
This UK money, my phone stay on roam
Safety on Glock, ice on rock
I rep Biggie since Rick Ross reppin Pac
I dont like too many rappers, or niggas 
If you see me talkin to cowards, its all figgas 
Gotta be ready to die to war with us 
Yea we three deep but there's plenty of more with us 
Chop it up, bag it up, set it up 
I got a problem on the strip, I wet it up 
I could get a ton on the arm, get your credit up
Talkin to the pilot on the Palm, then a senator 
You fake it nigga I get it shakin 
I'll shoot your wife at the dinner table like taken 
I did dirt since Krush Groove and Breakin' 
Now they got a Biggie movie, Pac comin next
You could suck my dick you said the LOX ain't the best 
Now yell "pause" and "no homo" that
And get a bullet in your fitted where the logo at 
Yea, another one by the NE sign 
Stab him in the face with the pen he signed 
Now that's that turn your fitted to a snapback
Yo, I'm the one that make the car start, engine
Hard liquor 2 week straight nigga, bingin' 
This dope, get your sniff on or syringin'
I'm really in these streets, they pretendin'
You compare him to these creeps, you offend him
Water and oil don't mix, you can't blend them
Trunk full of powder, cook it when I get there
It's me all alone on the throne, yea I sit there
 Now just let the haze burn
Bullets don't never change, they always burn
Majority is snakes, the rest is straight worms
Everybody's a baller, then I must be Dave Stern
Virus, whenever I spit I spray germs 
Who else been nice for this long and stayed firm? 
Donnie G, The Phantom and Al Qaeda
L-O-X the criminology coordinators I’m wandering free
Just living in a dream
Everyday that goes by
It’s the same old thing
I mean, you was either getting money or you wasn’t niggaFor my niggas
That been out of town man, to my niggas locked up doing what they had to do
Cocaine price, down south niggas with mouth full of ice risking my life
Fishscale beams, cokeboy dreams, out of town niggas tryna organize a team
Hiding all my money, hiding where I live
Vest if I get shot I’m hoping that I live new face out here tryna blend in
But I don’t wanna shine so I’m watching what I spend
Even switch my ID, insurance and registration legal on the v
I’m so low key
Bitches want me to fuck em bad but I chill cuzs
I don’t want their baby daddies getting mad 
My life has changed such a sunset on my new day
Over the horizon I know once in my life that the only way
Starting to show growth, moving work with ease
Pounds of that kush, halves and quarter keys Pills like GNC, vitamin shop
Everybody, white boys is comin’ to cop
My little shooter that I brought from up top
He stay packin but had a kid buy some chick out here now he slackin’
They caught my lil nigga comin’ out of the diner
Hit him up twice and his wig, but let that bitch live
Now he sittin’ on my nigga’s sofa playing X Box
Getting high while his stupid bitch cut up his rocks
My emotions telling me to go now so I load the 4 pound
But my old head told me to slow down 
I’m wandering free
Just living in a dream
Everyday that goes by
It’s the same old thing
Fuck these niggas man
Next week I get a call for a brick but I’m hearing that they crooked
And my lil homies life, I’m hearing that they took it
They try and get the God because my money is long
I killed this town, I’m a pop this nigga and be gone
Tell him meet me at the hotel on South and Atlantic
Next to Subways across from Bill the mechanic
I get out the car I hand him some shit
He hand me some money, I count it real quick now I’m ready to flip
I ask the nigga, do he know Felicia
He said naw, but he don’t know I had that bitch duct taped in the car
I pull out the thing, he started to run
I hit him once in his shoulder, he fell down then I stood right over
Looking at him eye to eye, fuck you and fuck these niggas in this town
Bitch nigga goodbye
I’m wandering free
Just living in a dream
Everyday that goes by
It’s the same old thing
I’m wandering free
Just living in a dream
Everyday that goes by
It’s the same old thingOhh

We too legit
Let me hear you rap something bout us
I'mma break the hands of the man who wrote your shit
We take minks off backs
Them grime niggas in clubs that make niggas walk
With them bodyguard cats
I'm glad I'm free
I feel like Harriet Tubman came and got me
From the white man property
It's all glitz and glitter but no cash you getting
You hear the difference in that shit that I'm spittin
Double R
That's street shit and that's the way it has to be
Myself , Sheek Louch , and I'm still MTV
I can talk about guns
Go out smack some nuns
Then flip and do a song with country music and shit
Don't ever play LOX for no fucking retard
Cuz your dough ain't that long that you can't see God
Plus these rap niggas out here respect the god
They know we spit that shit so they respect our sound
They know how hard a motherfucker is and water that's down
Here that's that shit right there
I swear from Yonkers motherfucker
We don't bust in the air
Ain't nobody killin clouds over here
Respect us
You bleed how we bleed

Ay yo this here is for them cats that wild nonstop
Can't dance just play the club and bop
No respect for the law
Fuck security son
Cuz you big that ain't stopping me from bustin my gun
It's a fact that fire burns and shit stink
It's also a fact that your vest only protectin your chest
You ain't think about your head when you was talkin that mess
Or this knife
Across your face scar you for life
Now do you really wanna rock that ice?
Heh heh
Do your security really love your life?
Or do they just want their check
You think they gon take one in the neck
For a nigga with no respect
For his crew
Man we don't wear half on Chinese food
Slept in the same bed
Same chick gave us head
Brothers , and we ain't gon stop till we all dead
Ain't shit gon change
Just the dough gon change
Fuck a Bentley
I'm good with a rubberband colored range
I empty a clip at you you send nothing in exchange
Y'all niggas mad soft no heart all brains
But what's smart when a dumb dumb burst your heart
I'm done now but first hold up hold your applause
I got one question to ask y'all do y'all niggas want war?

{*slot machine sound simulated by a synth keyboard*}
Ohh! Yo I hit? We rich my niggas! We rich! Ha ha!
Koch, whattup? No more lookin back now nigga
It is what it is bitch, I'm ready
For the road again - I got my money, my passport
My gun is loaded, nigga I'm ready
For the road again - I got my weed, a couple niggas
Some liquor, the new Madden, I'm ready
For the road again - I'm in your town puttin it down
Bankheadin and all that, I'm ready
For the road again - I'm goin back out my niggas
All aboard bitches, OWW!
Hey yo, my momma struggled for me, poppa juggled for me
My niggas huddled for me, they said you gotta let 'em off
Let him do his thing 
Y'all ain't tryin to work with him, let him spread his wings
Let him go out in the world, see a couple things 
See what's workin for him, see who chirpin for him
For what shows and what label is lurkin for him 
I got it bitin ma, I've been writin ma 
I've cut down on drinkin but I've been lightin ma
You've gotta see my stage show, I'm excitin ma
Your boy nice  - dropped my album, did around 400
I expected double, I guess they didn't want it
Niggas stayin blunted, walk with me zit
We can pop it in and you ain't gotta touch shit
Anyway; back to the drawin board
I'm independent now, whoever with me all aboard
Hold on son - hey yo Foolz rewind that back my nigga
I think I forgot, I gotta tell 'em a lil' more shit
That happened between me and shit
Aight that's far enough let's go
Hey yo, anyway, Kadar about to leave 
P comin home, Ruff Ryders lost Eve 
'Kiss asked "Why," how kids gotta die
To Mr. George Bush and his sales hit the sky 
Ja reached out with this "New York" idea 
'Kiss from the hood so he was like hell yeah 
50 gettin mad, came out with "Piggy Bank"
That was probably the best song he had
We had to shit on him , Game quit on him 
Now we got it locked like we sicked the pit on him 
We're takin meetings, but we don't wanna go major
Cause we know how these artists takin beatings
Plus I seen how these down South niggas do it
Eight dollars? Shit, I could get used to it
Look at Lil' Jon, nigga got his own fluid 
Ying Yang and them, they can show you how to do it
Now I'm gettin crunk with Koch and them
All these new niggas spittin? I'm watchin them
I got a thousand songs like 'Pac and them
And niggas prayin for me like Ak and them 
My son is born, I'm back alive
I caught a DWI tryin to drink and drive 
I'm huggin the bottle, I'm hittin the throttle
Got a beat tape playin tryin to think some bars
Like weed I just put 'em in my mental jars
'Til I get up in the booth and space out like Mars 
I'm ready for it  I already saw it
A lot of shit about to change, niggas can't ignore it
For the road again50 you a rat, you a coward, you a snitch
You a bitch motherfucker now hear this {*tch-tch BOOM*}
All you talk about is money and sales
What you need to talk about is all them niggas that you put in them jails
We don't dry snitch niggas  rappin and whisperin
Knowin that the rap police listenin
Homey know just what he doin, who career he swipe
That's aight, Ja got him, niggas say goodnight 
I'mma blast 'til I go on the run
Just mad at Game cause he ain't like them, he ain't your son 
50 this, 50 that; nigga 50 whack 
Nigga laid you down, when you gon' get him back? 
And when you gon' say somethin hot on the track? 
I guess the next time you get hit'll be your back
A fucked up nigga, let me get down wit'chu
I make sure niggas don't hit you - ha ha
Hey yo maybe if I siiiiing, I'll be rich 
And maybe if I rat on you, I'll be rich 
Maybe if I crossover, I'll be rich 
I wanna beeee, I wanna be, just like that 50 bitch 
Maybe if I siiiiing, I'll be rich 
And maybe if I rat on you, I'll be rich 
Maybe if I crossover, I'll be rich 
I wanna beeee, I wanna be, just like that 50 bitch
Hey yo Banks you got a half-assed flow
But fuckin with homey, all you gon' get is half-assed dough
And where the fuck was you at wit'cha big-ass face
When I was writin "Benjamins" with 'Kiss, Diddy and Ma$e
I ain't heard of you homey, 'til you blew up quick
But back then I'm pretty sure that you was on my dick 
I dropped L.O.X., chest to chest, back to back
On Clue when, "If You Think I'm Jiggy" was whack
I wore shiny suits, niggas knew I didn't belong
But even back then I still never sang on a song
I've been white-tee'd out  white haze and hash
It's fucked up, 50 makin y'all wear that trash
What he do, put your clothes on the bed, put your sneakers on the floor
And tell you what hat to put on your head? 
You lil' muh'fuckers to me daddy
And I don't give a fuck if the doors lift up in your Caddy
Go Young Buck  that's my nigga 
Even if 50 don't let you get bigger
I see you run around stage wit'cha shirt off; you need some food
You 'bout as big as "The Passion of Christ" dude
And I still got love for the dirty South
But I ain't gon' respect no nigga with my dick in his mouth
G-Unit gon' be gone once Dre bounce on you 
And it's fucked up cause Eminem tried to warn you
You ain't as big as these white dudes that cut your check
Think so? Wait and see who they go to next 
You forgot about the hood scramps
Everybody ain't workin with bricks, some niggas got gramps
No new guns, just them shits that jam
Fuck it though, I'mma ride wit'chu do the death
D-Block muh'fucker 'til there's no one left
G-G-G-G-G-G... the fuck outta here!
 minus the 
D-Block! bring that ass
Vinny Idol, what up?
Donnie
Yeah
It's an understatement if you say I'm on my grind
They say I'm underrated, see them comments all the time
I was on the block holdin' guns, doin' crime
Baggin' up crack before Mary heard me rhyme
These dirty little bitches tryin' to turn into a dime
I ain't fuck you back then, won't fuck you in my prime
Dark lookin' half-ounce in Patron with some lime
Couple bottle orders to my table and I'm fine
Still be ridin' dirty, rather have it than be slippin'
Got a lot to lose so all my niggas think I'm trippin'
We ain't gotta argue, I already got the clip in
I turn a nigga purple like that nasty shit he sippin'
All that bread you got, why you put it on the 'Gram?
You ain't pay your child support, how the fuck is you the man?
We was in the kitchen had that Coke under the fan
Let it dry, chopped it up, then we came up with a plan
Lox
I just came up off a gram, get the Benz truck, wagon series
Ten thousand dollars on Denim, I left with Madam Mary
Niggas can't believe that I made it, I know they mad to hear me
I grew up on The Lox, you can hear it, them niggas had to feel me
When Sheek spit that 24 Hours To Live verse, plug got robbed and gave us twenty-four hours to live first
I done got rich off this rap, could have honestly did worse
I ain't cocky, they just copied all the shit I did first
How you claimin' that you hard when you ain't never been to D-Block?
Got your bitch in my lap and it sound like she tryna' beat-box
Caught him lackin' in his own hood, chased him for three blocks
Tangerine seats in the 'Prese drop, thug life make you think 
On the last run right before the game was over
We used to whip the work with a fifty cent cobra
I was in the stew but the crew was sleepin' over
We made a couple hunnid, fuck around and bought a Rover
Then we got the deals like a nigga found a clover
Clue freestyles where we got our most exposure
We was only doin' what the older niggas showed us
After the advance we was still sellin' boulders
Industry hate it 'cause they could never control us
Bad bitch under the dryer, she in the rollers
Big shout out to all the soldiers
Fuck it, we got rich, that's what the overall goal was
We was in the kitchen had that Coke under the fan
Let it dry, chopped it up, then we came up with a plan
We was in the kitchen had that Coke under the fan
Let it dry, chopped it up, chop, chop, chopped it up
We, we was in the kitchen had that coke under the fan
Let it dry, chopped it up, then we came up with a plan
We, we was in the kitchen had that coke under the fan
Let it dry, chopped it up, then we 
LoxUhh, hahah, Ruff Ryders niggas 
 Blood in blood out
Funk Doc, Sheek Luc', Meth-Tical 
Yo, yo, aiyyo yo
Soon as I cop the nine, I pop the nine
When I take it out the box, I represent LOX
Now when I flow, you hit the rewind button
So I charge out more, want it all at the door
Fuck heat, Sheek walk around with an oven
Who you gonna kill with that little Foreman grill?
How its gon' look when I come through your block?
Sheek, Funk Doc, Meth on top
Porsche, 300 horse fly by
Back open pumpin "How High?" 
Yeah, can y'all see that 
Bitch you can call me what you want, 'cuz "I'll Be Dat" 
Get off my dick, I don't care about no jewels
Long as the condo's paid and the truck I choose
I'm tellin y'all niggas, if its not double R
I'mma spell my name out on the side of your car
Come and Ruff Ryde with us
If you wanna get high with us
If you wanna get down with us
Come on nooooowwwww
Come and Ruff Ryde with us
If you wanna get high with us
If you wanna get down with us
Come on nooooowwwww
I got a twin cam exhaust connected to the jaw
A five speed clutch on my paw when I write
I glow like the pegs in Lite-Brite
3000 volts of lightning when you fly the right kite
Me and Meth be Hennessy, two ice cubes
We can draw  or do I choose?
When I choose the grip, one shot lose your hip
I hope your shoes fit for this move and pick
I avalanche your camp with, ten feet of snow
I'm cold blooded, my fam half-eskimo
My flows move like indo;
Turn ten nickels to ten loads, outta ten sto's
Ride the crash course, do the math on it
Swizz Beats you can ride Amtrak on it
But I'm on it, grillin with George Foreman
Ya peeps is at the Grammy Awards cornin
The ice, the fat wallet son, I want it
And the helicopter warmin before mornin
Def Jam nigga, Redman nigga
Got - "fuck ya momma" on my sweat band nigga
You tough guys'll get smacked in the club
COme with the gun I bought from Mack in the club
Its P-P-P from Bricks to Brook-nam 
 Bring me some more ass to whoop on
Look what the cat dragged in
Underground dweller from the cellar bring terror
Scoop a high yellow Cinderella, Meth forever
Never rush a rhyme, hope to never bust my nine
But if I have to, I have to, it's all in the mind
I stay ahead of time while y'all fallin behind
Tryin to relight ya lime
It's a crime when I drop bomb lines designed
To tick, tick, BOOM blow your mind
Yeah me, M-E-T, H, the O, the D
Can't be done, like tryin to find a penny in the sea
Nigga run for cover son go and get them guns
Y'all ain't from here, don't try to come around here gettin ones
Swizz Beat the track in the head, but I instead
Pull my dart gun and bust sixteen until it's dead
I'm the game, all of my dogs be off the chain
Yellin Wu.. Tang, Wu.. Tang It's the dance step, it's the BOUNCE!
 Gotta make sure I don't spill my drink on this
 Ha ha ha ha! It's the swagger
G's up homey
I'ma get money, get money
I don't care if your peoples act funny
I'ma go loco, straight loco
Aiyyo mamis pass the trey-ocho
Cause we do it, straight do it
You coulda came with us ma but you blew it
Make it hot boo, bring your friend too
And drop it like you supposed to, ah-HA!
You know what this is lil' momma
You could walk around with the top of a pajama
Boxers on, pillow case over the llama
Drama; I deal with more weed than a farmer
Point blank, dot dot, period, comma
 So gritty, but still so pretty
Broke and I get as much pussy as Diddy
Ante up, catty all candied up
I'm on ice like I just won the Stanley Cup
Yup! Stay booted up, a little 'gnac in the cup
About to score, the homey had to shoot it up
 23's, low pros on top of a flatbed
 Niggas think I just got towed - nope!
To the car show, Murciélago
Hammer in the cargo - what's my name? 
Sheek Louch that boy there 'bout to change the game
Aiyyo; I ain't gon' lie, it's a lot of things I can't buy
But if I really want it bad  and really get mad 
I'ma grab the strap like a muh'fuckin dad
To get what I want, if it take me a month
And pitch my lil' pieces right in the front
Smoke my blunt, and drink my 'gnac
And watch my back like I'm under attack 
A lot of people think I don't like their ass
Guess what?  I really don't like their ass
And won't hesitate to put somethin in you fast 
So you can go 'head with that bullcrap
Cause I don't mean rhymes when I say I ain't afraid of a murder rap
Aiyyo - she said she love my flow, and the things that I say
And how the rest of my crew is so caliente
You D-Block boys really know how to play 
When the next LOX album, I'm just waitin for the day
Look Range, Bent' Coupe, house, indoor hoop
Chain got enough karats to put in grandma soup
I ain't in the loop, I'm nowhere near you
I'm in the hood dawg where them peoples scare youAiyyo Poobs let's go nigga - ahh, woo!
Ayyyo, I said I'm sicker than yo' average
One up in yo' cabbage and leave you there
I only brought the revolver here, no shells
Throw the jacks away I ain't talkin on cells
Get low, get a hoe, tell her where to go
Fuck her 'til her pussy sore, make her watch the door
I said I'm sicker than yo' average
Pump in the baby carriage, no fear
Nine in the Build-a-Bear, listen here homey
I said I'm sicker than yo' average
If I don't know homey I'ma fuck up his marriage
Get head from her, get a little bread from her
Put cum stains in his Hummer, listen dawg
I said I'm sicker than yo' average
You ain't know Sheek was a muh'fuckin savage
That's why I don't mingle, cause when I get a tingle
I turn into a wolf  ski-mask time
E'rything I see around your neck that's mine
I leave a nigga white tee red on up
I only shoot from the head on up  nuttin else dawg
I said I'm sicker than yo' average
Sheek Louch..
Yo 
Say no more
Fuck a shank I'm open, clappers get to loadin
Leave the burners smokin runnin tryin to tuck it in
All black niggas tryin to figure what the fuck I'm in
The Haze farmer, the leather bomber, the long shank
I throw "Gasoline" on bitches like Daddy Yank'
Suck my dick if you ain't my clique
I should cum out your mouth if you ain't no chick
Bitch, I'm too itchy, I need foot powder for my hands
I make clam chowder quick out one of your mans
In the hood we don't care about you
You ain't nuttin to my niggas, we don't hear about you
You hear  yeah that's my niggas comin through
You hear shots fired, probably D-Block niggas too
The egg crate sittin on top of the trey-eight
Everything cool but you can tell that I can't wait
To jump into his chest, or jump into his vest
Either one I don't know why he wan' jump into this mess
Yes, let it go down, once and for all
I just hope y'all niggas ready to brawl, let's go
{*wolf howls*}Lyrics for this song have yet to be released. Please check back once the song has been released.What I've learned, from this thug life I'm livin', is it's a cold, cold world
I know at times it gets to ya
Gotta keep pushin', gotta keep pushin'
Gotta keep pushin', gotta keep pushin'
Gotta keep pushin', you gotta keep pushin'
And at any given moment you can end up with your back on the wall
I know at times it gets to ya
Gotta keep , you gotta keep 
You know you gotta keep , you gotta keep 
You know you gotta keep , you gotta keep pushin'
Uh, yeah, 'cause I push, I push
And that money a drop, and them bottles a pop
And I'm at the bar, with my big cigar
With my shades and hoody on, I'm a superstar
With my hands up high, and I'm extra high
And she extra fly, tell ya friends goodbye
Yeah, westside doin' it, can only fit two in it
The night is good, so don't ruin it
We gon' make it, or we gon' take it
Respect is everything, so please don't break it
If you still in the hood and ya rent is due
I wrote this song for you, for you
What I've learned, from this thug life I'm livin', is it's a cold, cold world
I know at times it gets to ya
Gotta keep pushin', gotta keep pushin'
Gotta keep pushin', gotta keep pushin'
Gotta keep pushin', you gotta keep pushin'
And at any given moment you can end up with your back on the wall
I know at times it gets to ya
Gotta keep , you gotta keep 
You know you gotta keep , you gotta keep 
You know you gotta keep , you gotta keep pushin'
I just party and BS like B.I. said
Old school, keep a hundred stacks under the bed
With the time red six hundred, call it a sled
Little yak, little greenery to clear my head
But you gotta keep pushin', you gotta keep whippin'
The landlord callin', the baby sitter is flippin'
You ready to drop everything, you think about skippin'
But you strong and you gon' make it all good
Back to the wall and you gon' keep it all hood
Put ya drinks up, five cent cups
Ace of spades whatever, I don't give a, give a
If ya rent's due I wrote this song for you, for you
What I've learned, from this thug life I'm livin', is it's a cold, cold world
I know at times it gets to ya
Gotta keep pushin', gotta keep pushin'
Gotta keep pushin', gotta keep pushin'
Gotta keep pushin', you gotta keep pushin'
And at any given moment you can end up with your back on the wall
I know at times it gets to ya
Gotta keep , you gotta keep 
You know you gotta keep , you gotta keep 
You know you gotta keep , you gotta keep pushin'
Uh, pay day's here, even though there's nothing left
The club's packed, everybody fresh to death
New swag, I'm confident that you can bag her
Gas in the tank, can I buy you a drink?
The music all loud, she dancin' all wild
Can't tell me shorty ain't the hottest in the crowd
What I've learned, from this thug life I'm livin', is it's a cold, cold world
I know at times it gets to ya
Gotta keep pushin', gotta keep pushin'
Gotta keep pushin', gotta keep pushin'
Gotta keep pushin', you gotta keep pushin'
And at any given moment you can end up with your back on the wall
I know at times it gets to ya
Gotta keep , you gotta keep 
You know you gotta keep , you gotta keep 
You know you gotta keep , you gotta keep pushin'Yeah!
I know how to do this, daddy
I done made more trips south than Luda's caddy
I done been on the block, bust off the Glock
And dealt with more beef than a fucking patty
Sheek ain't fuckin' wit' y'all, want nothing with y'all
You ain't gon' rat on me, before that a whole clip will be left of ease
Body left somewhere in a dumpster laid on pee 
I'm a mothafuckin thug, you would think I'm on every drug
But I ain't, just 'gnac and an occasional , nigga
My crate out in the front wit a deuce deuce a Newport and half of my weight out
When they dry they bring the other half of the plate out
I'm so sick wit it, spit liq' wit it
I got tommy guns like the ol' gangsta flicks did it, yeah!
Who hooder than me? Who gooder than me?
Lettin off, nigga, all my guns stay on ease
How many guns?
Just a few, we can do it in broad day to see the kind of work I do
Who hooder than me? Who gooder than me?
Lettin off, nigga, all my guns stay on ease
How many guns?
Just a few,I'm quick on the trigga, I'm Sheek Louch the Guerilla, nigga
Woo! There's so much tension
Sheek let it off in broad day and I ain't squinchin'
Gat to my face and I ain't flinchin'
Somebody stayin' there like detention
And you ain't gotta like me, homie
But just stay in yo lane and keep it to yoself
That way everything you think can stay in yo brain
Nose in the 'caine, but that's yo biz
If it's my work to be sniffin up, then next week
It's gon' be six niggas pickin up yo bitch-ass body
No chest under your suit, that ain't cute
Loud-mouth niggas ain't the mute 
I'm the reason for locks on the door
I'm the reason why Coast Guards is on the shore
Open up, made Poppi have to lower his 
Mom and Pop put a number spotter in the back of the store, 
I throw spinners on the 18-wheeler
And pull up with a bunch of naked bitches in the D-Block trailer
Who hooder than me? Who gooder than me?
Sheek be on some shit like flies in a bee
My wrist so rocky I'm on and off roads
Money dirty so I need to do a laundry load
I don't blow up I make the whole town explode
Yo boy Sheek name heavy in every zip code
Sheek gets off the clutch
Doin Donuts in the street, I make smoke screens without a Dutch
They gon' need a gas mask for you
Baby boy, I go hard
I break bones like Jackass dudes
How many guns?
Just a few, but you never know what you gon' get till the shell come through
Blood, sweat, and tears
'Gnac and some beers
You ain't heard no shit like this in yearsBlacksaun 
Check my kitchen if you ain't cookin' right, nigga
Ooh woo
Back up on that blow 
Cut up all that dope 
V12 in the engine, know we out here on the road
I'm makin' plays 
Bitch, you know I got it for the low
I'm makin' plays 
Bitch, you know we got it off the boat 
Back up on that blow 
Cut up all that dope 
V12 in the engine, know we out here on the road
I'm makin' plays 
Bitch, you know I got it for the low

Bitch, you know we got it off the boat 
Hey yo, black band on my waist 
Black mask on my face 
Black fist in the air 
Still we cook up base
B-B-Black 9 on my waist 
Black mask on my face 
Black fist in the air 
Still we cook up base
We gon' get this money  couple different ways 
Rap game or drug game, bitch, I'm makin' plays
I'm makin' plays
I used to come up out that buildin' duckin' strays
I'm still here, thank God, I'm amazed 
O.G. beard startin' to get them greys
Back in the days I used to tie a nigga up 
Bring him to his house
Bitch get to screamin', put the gun up in her mouth 
Then we flip the mattress 
Shoebox under bed 
Homie move again, I put a window in his head
Back up on that blow 
Cut up all that dope 
V12 in the engine, know we out here on the road
I'm makin' plays 
Bitch, you know I got it for the low
I'm makin' plays 
Bitch, you know we got it off the boat 
Back up on that blow 
Cut up all that dope 
V12 in the engine, know we out here on the road
I'm makin' plays 
Bitch, you know I got it for the low
I'm makin' plays 
Bitch, you know we got it off the boat 
Ski mask on my face, duct tape on the handle
Bando full of fiends, he supposed to sample off the candle
I don't push unless it's pure though
Fuck the D.A. and the bureau
Heavy nights of slingin' white, my plug Eddie can count the churros
D-Blockin' like a motherfucker
Got the streets on lock with the heat on cock 'cause I'm a gun lover
I delete your top
The best prices in the town
The flight just hit the ground
Flood the streets, we 'bout to feast
I bet they like it white or brown
Foreign whippin', Dom Perignon sippin' 
A new extension and a scope for long distance 
You's a fool if you think you want it with us 
Trained to go, all my niggas all killas 
Back up on that blow 
Cut up all that dope 
V12 in the engine, know we out here on the road
I'm makin' plays 
Bitch, you know I got it for the low
I'm makin' plays 
Bitch, you know we got it off the boat 
Back up on that blow 
Cut up all that dope 
V12 in the engine, know we out here on the road
I'm makin' plays 
Bitch, you know I got it for the low
I'm makin' plays 
Bitch, you know we got it off the boat {Verse 1}
You know me as the motherfuckin' "Love me"
I could back like rugby
I could see the game is gettin' ugly
I want that she out of it
I'ma make you proud of it
She here to separate the real from the counterfeit
Look at how I got 'em up
DJ! Put my record back! 
Know you's an autotune because I'm not to used to that
Spit wit' the steady flow
Years I had steady though
Whether it came from rap or fuckin' wit' the petty ho'
Blaze that, I could leave a space wit' your face at
Now just want a pussy, ma?
I ain't try to chase that
Done being incredible
All yellers had a ball
Fuckin' up the game practice - you panicking!
{Hook - 2x}
Motherfucka we run shit, run quick!
Go get your gun, quick!
We get it poppin' ova here!
Y'ain't poppin' ova there!
My niggas get it poppin' right here!
{Verse 2}
Let's Go!
Back in the street again, beat again
Niggas on my minigun
Pose bitches want me to beat again
Nigga want to clear the V-I-P out
Niggas know what we 'bout
Piss out before I pull the peace out
Now what?
Hit 'em here know we got his face cut
Nigga think he swayin' till we licking and we taste blood
I fuck the club up, we live to rug up
Patrol and five or ten hoes just to rub up!
Whip southside, ... boy, 
Bitches surround my car
Cameras out, I'm so superstar! 
/?Keep?/ it close to me
Who you supposed to be?
It's a reverb for blues, /?say ho it's donna we G?/
{Hook - 2x}
{Verse 3}
Somebody pull them shakers out
See what they /?think?/ about
Hey, crack, make a nigga go and get the paper out!
He know, hope you wanna flow when they hit blow
My niggas aiming at the crowd, at innocent people
D-Block, niggas wit' an attitude in pack, 
White tea, money green,
M.I.B. jet black
Kush got me feelin' light-headed
Two things we don't do - money & bitches - we don't sweat it!
I told y'all to motherfuckin' man to be back here, 
It's your time to re-up on songs from last year
Now I'm back smoothin' in your grandma cashmere
If this ain't my year, I ain't pre-pare
WHAT UP?
{Hook - 2x}Intro: Sheek Louch
Ok  Ok ok ok
Y.O. where you at?  Bronx where you at? 
Harlem where you at?  Brooklyn where you at?
Verse 1: Sheek Louch
Now what you know about me
I got this rap shit down to a tee
Grams to a half, half to a ki
Empties alone 'gon cost me a G
My flow too deadly baby
No fakin hold the hammer steadily baby
No shakin you still wanted to pop off
Until I come through slow with the top off
You ain't real you just a knock off
Y'all ain't sick that's just a light light cough
Sheek heavy in the hood
Rims spin heavy in the hood dash heavy with wood
Niggas try get me if they could
But they know the handle is wood and my aim is good
Sheek keeps it real, from the streets to the motherfuckin yards at jail
Chorus: Sheek Louch
I don't know what you thinkin but a party ain't a party unless you drinkin
And, I don't know what's all the drama
But he keep on frontin better call his mama
And, I don't know what you thinkin but a party ain't a party unless you drinkin
And, I don't know what's all the drama
But he keep on frontin better call his mama, and
Verse 2: Sheek Louch
Nah, I ain't thuggin I'm here to party
And I, I don't party I'm here to thug
I don't know taste this drink I think it's drugged
Then ummm, he keep talkin he will get plugged
Listen, tell shorty I got the hot tub
If she try and wash a little sweat off from the club
And, tell her friends they could come if they want
Cause my niggas got a line full of whips in the front
And, I know you playmate of the month
And you model for Vicky Secret 
But ain't no runway here and you ain't there
So you might as well let us skeet, bitch, ha ha!
Bridge: Sheek Louch
Ok, ok ok ok 
New York where you at?  Cali where you at? 
Miami where you at?  Atlanta where you at?
Chorus: Sheek Louch
I don't know what you thinkin but a party ain't a party unless you drinkin
And, I don't know what's all the drama
But he keep on frontin better call his mama
And, I don't know what you thinkin but a party ain't a party unless you drinkin
And, I don't know what's all the drama
But he keep on frontin better call his mama, and
Verse 3: Sheek Louch
It ain't nothin but a word to come out the trunk on these cats
With this that and a third
But Sheek tryin to chill
Get up on somethin go over there and ice your grill
Damn! All these chicks in here, all this ass for free
And you wanna stare at me?!
I don't know what you thinkin or what you drinkin
But you better go and get some ass before
Chorus: Sheek Louch
I don't know what you thinkin but a party ain't a party unless you drinkin
And, I don't know what's all the drama
But he keep on frontin better call his mama, and
And, I don't know what you thinkin but a party ain't a party unless you drinkin
And, I don't know what's all the drama
But he keep on frontin better call his mama, and

Gilla House, D-Block baby 
Yo, hey yo
Get up, stand up - throw your hands up
All my thug niggas throw your motherfuckin hands up
Get up, stand up - throw your hands up
All y'all pretty bitches throw your motherfuckin hands up
Hey yo, I got a letter from the governor, the other day
I opened, I read it, and this is what it say
It's time for you to get yo' stack right
The bitch don't act right, whatever put that bitch on the next flight
Whatever nigga step in your way, hit his ass with the K
And leave his body where his children'll play
I cook somethin up like Emeril's kitchen
I put the heat to these rap dudes, whatever let me know who's bitchin
And your security as pussy as you are
The burners come out, his big ass be the first to the car
I got goons that'll make it spark, and I don't gotta throw a blow
Niggas ready to stage dive like they Linkin Park
The hood love a nigga cause I ain't above a nigga
I eat the same shit in the hood as another nigga
White tee, pants saggin, ready to mug a nigga
Get the hell up out your seats and everybody jump
Yo - yo Sheek lemme get some of that, yo
Aiyyo my uzi weigh a ton, Redman half baked
I'm smokin pounds, you hang around with Nasty Nate
The great dane straight change, bitches close drapes
Cause my product, Ultramagnetic like Kool Keith
This for my hood niggas sellin sticky by the sto'
I rip your hottest MC like eenie mynie moe
Fuck dough I do it for fun, "Juice" like Bishop
"American Pie" nigga, hit your momma like Stiffler
Redman and Sheek Louch, you got a brief clue
Who will tie you up like E did to P in "Beef Two"
I cheat dude, give me a Maybach to breathe
So I'm determined, like AJ after Free
I don't play games I'm grown, on 26 chrome
Inside of my truck is ESPN Zone
Shame on a nigga, that try to run game on a nigga
I bring pain on a nigga
Hey yo fuck that nigga, buck that nigga
Chase him to the roof, somebody cut that nigga
Pushed 1100, one wheel up 
Lil' entrepeneur; shit, I'm already one deal up 
Grants to a bird - okay, I ain't sell a lot
But shit Jigga ain't go platinum 'til his third
I'm one song away, but you would think I did
How the house got that long ass drive-a-way
Benz in the back, doors do Karate Kid
If they knew I get the same time Gotti did
240 when it's floored, trey pound on my lap
Beyonce bobblehead on the dashboard
Can't be ignored, I'm the coke niggas can't afford
I'm the town niggas haven't toured
I got a dutch or two, we can smoke a few
But first this is what y'all motherfuckers gotta do
Yeah, Brick City, all the way to Yonkers baby
We got Yonkers goin bonkers baby!
We got Yonkers goin bonkers baby!
Yo Funk Doc, Sheek Louch, you know what it is baby
Gilla House, D-Block!D-Block, D-Block, D-Block, D-Block
D-Block, D-Block, D-Block, D-Block
D-Block, D-Block, D-Block, D-Block
Ohh shit!

La-da-da, da-da-daaaah 
You can kiss yo' ass goodbye 
La-da-da, da-da-daaaah
Aiyyo, this that shit that make niggas wanna rep they clique 
Grab their gun and diss niggas to their dick
Buck somethin, go somewhere and fuck somethin 
Like that frontin nigga bitch, make her suck somethin 
Wild out, D-Block shirt inside out
Hoodie on with the all black Belushis on
Niggas yappin 'til they muh-fuckin face is torn 
Tongue is gone  three-piece suits is worn
Hit y'all faggot-ass niggas that's scared to death
Talk shit, when I'm around y'all hold y'all breath 
I make murder music, my shit bang in the city
But they want me to chill since Janet showed titty
I don't know no other way but to rap gritty 
Fuck that baby when I'm rich
Until then where the fuck is my thugs at up in this bitch? 
Whattup nigga, you cut up nigga 
Shoot shit to lift the truck up nigga 
D-Block, D-Block howl like a wolf
Tell your mom I throw a child off the roof
Give a basshead a hundred dollars to towel off the Coupe 
Style on niggas; beat somethin down
We gon' pile on niggas  wild on niggas
{La-da-da, da-da-daaaah} That's a lullaby for you 
Better ask your man he ready to die for you 
We comin through tearin the block up 
We ain't gettin locked up  that mean we even shootin the cops up
Whattup?  
Whattup, whattup?  Now we in the New York rhyme
Better kiss that ass goodbye, when I'm passin by
With plastic nines to blast your eyes, right
What, nigga?
Aiyyo, I talk shit how I wanna talk, bop how I wanna walk
And you can tell that nigga dere is from New York
And I still got my South niggas ready to squeeze
I don't need cake to see me with a couple of G's 
And I don't need a loan, muh'fucker I'm grown
Had a thirty-eight before I had a phone
I stuck niggas up before y'all lil' niggas started to bone
This that Sheek Louch shit y'all niggas tryin to clone
Let's be real, the average muh'fucker with a deal
Probably never had a fight  no guns, none of that
Niggas know I'm right  I say goodnight to my son
Give my baby moms a lil' cake
And my moms a lil' somethin 'fore I go on the run
Before pussy niggas try their hand
I'll kick in the door like "Daddy's Home" and I ain't "Making the Band"
What y'all coward niggas don't understand?  
 You can kiss yo' ass goodbye...Hey, come here baby
I know you ain't tired
Whaa, what that mean, ay pour a drink

Money come and go but life got one shot
So live yours nigga stop bitching what you ain’t got

Couple bullets with no names on it got my homies laid out
Yo face frowned up but not cus I’m ice grilling
Spilling tequila shots white linen party on yachts

From hard work and suffering
From hustling and struggling
From coming up from nothing

Being young in the projects trying to make progress couldn’t find my way out
Couple bullets with no names on it got my homies laid out

Long shit with the black spots like a giraffe
Clear my path when the guy walking
How you try getting in the club I hope you jump in my coffin
Besides D-Block I don't see that oftenI heard a hatin' nigga runnin' his mouth again
I wish the bitch nigga make up his mind
He gon' clap when he see me, he gon' fuck me up
I come through watch the nigga go blind
I'm standin' right here nigga, what's up?
Ain't shit changed
You know the nine got a muzzle on it and I'm in close range
Do somethin' nigga!
When you see em' you gon' fuck him up, you said that shit
Then you seen 'em and ain't do shit, dead that shit
'Sup with you nigga? Tryna' not to fuck with you niggas
All I did since birth keep it a buck with you niggas
If I offend you, fuck you, nigga
You ain't my man, I let it touch you, nigga
Rip up and cut you, nigga
You got birds, I send the goons and let 'em pluck you nigga
You ain't about shit, that's why I duck you niggas
If it's money to be made and we can split it, I'm with it
But if it's only one-sided just for you, forget it
Like if I had to go to jail and I got a lot of mail at least one of them letters was from you
Niggas'll turn they back on you and I ain't even locked up
But we go back to the mixtapes with Clue
Who? Donnie, I got that chrome four-four

Funny shit and they know you ain't 'bout that action, homie
They actin' phoney, that's why I carry this ratchet on me
No jewels, got 'em shiverin' though
Now everybody seen a drip but it ain't drizzlin' though
Keep most of the work stashed, then get rid of the snow

Now I done heard a million times about how you gon' kill 'em
But you ain't do shit when you seen 'em but ice grill 'em

Type to catch a body in the booth, another Mike Villain
These niggas get shot and stabbed and turned realer
Man, shut your little monkey ass's down around gorillas
I get back to back bids in the yard with them killers
Give 'em triple beam bars so the hustlers'll feel ya
It's quiet when they peel ya, keep that muzzle on that handgun
Smack a nigga up before I clap him, that's an and-one
You heard Louch in the spot with the four-four
I'm in the kitchen with the twenty-gauge cookin' up more
I heard a hatin' nigga runnin' his mouth again
I wish the bitch nigga make up his mind
He gon' clap when he see me, he gon' fuck me up
I come through watch the nigga go blind
I'm standin' right here nigga, what's up?
Ain't shit changed
You know the nine got a muzzle on it and I'm in close range
Do somethin' nigga!
Nigga talkin' like he 'bout that action but I ain't saw nothin'
But you was all tough when you was pillow talkin' to that bird bitch we all fuckin'

Hittin' the gate, tryna' dip and escape
We from the same hood, you jealous of the shit in my safe
You tellin' niggas how you gon' lay me down and take my jewelry off
Mad 'cause I got the city lit and he wanna cool me off
Guess it's fuck all the blunts that we burned together
This nigga broke and he want what I earned
Sayin' you gon' do this and that

I was born to stand out, I don't care if I don't fit
True story, I grew up around coke
I was only seven when I first seen my pops smoke
Uncle was sniffin' somethin', not sure what that was
Kept rubbin' his nose, put his jacket on backwards
Found out what crack was, then I found a hundred pack
I don't care whose shit it was, we sold it in the back
Moms on her grind, workin' , tryna do her thing
Had me at sixteen, tryna raise a king
It was through the grace of God for all this rap shit 
Had a bunch of fights but I was down to clap shit
Had a bunch friends now I probably got six
Used to have a lot but they was actin' like chicks
I guess I got older, seen what it was
Money bring jealousy, I seen what it does 
Smokin' my weed, loadin' my chrome
I'm with my family or I'm alone
I'm alone
Alone
Alone, alone, alone
'Cause I'm alone, ah

Sheek Louch's hood, they know I'm strapped
D-Block, D-Block, LOX shit is way more than rap
New York, New York, Yonkers, put it on the map

Just left the states, now I'm in Dubai
These fake niggas hatin' but I know why

AloneThis is steel Glock music slash hip-hop music
Slash rock music, no, not pop music
This is heavy at the bar, big cigar, hood chick wit'chu
Fat ass, somethin loud in the cat
Long-ass barrel, the shells big
All black mask over me, chick anne in a cold wig
Comin through newhaven, 24's what i'm cravin
Ain't that scary? tv's "something about mary"
System up, alpine just on 9
Lil' kids wanna open the blind, it's a hood thing
I make these dudes wanna get more, that's a good thing
Hold up; i ain't no role model
I just make a model roll up, send her to the stage and hit the pole up
Liquor drinkin, club small
Hood little hole in the wall, that's where i be y'all
Chain hangin like "what?! come rob me"
Hood rats  ladies 
I'ma make 'em make 'em scrap to this, uhh, gyeah
Hood rats  ladies 
I'ma make 'em make 'em scrap to this, uhh
Put your hands up  put your hands up 
I'ma make 'em make 'em scrap to this, uhh
Put your hands up  put your hands up 
I'ma make 'em make 'em scrap to this, let's go
I like to smoke and go past the clouds
Like to drink and don't stand there homey, i walk through crowds
I ain't a trouble maker, i'm just not soft
But these dudes will shoot, so please don't push me
I've been workin out, startin to get a nice little build
We can scrap on the other wing, get you killed
Ain't no formula here, i just spit what i want
I don't care what's in rotation or hot for the month
I don't stress the pd to play my song
A hit is a hit, with sheek you know what you get
Somethin crazy that the streets eat'll up
So don't matter if it's there yet homey; it will heat up
I'm right there - o.g. slash young boys nightmare
Yeah, what i do in the booth
Sheek walk around with, what they shoot off the roof
Ain't that the truth, one thing you just can't change
And that's hood love when everything else seems strange
Now these chickens wanna jump in my clique
They say you got a club hit, when it die they don't watch you forget
That's why i push it to the limit, like ross that's it!
"i'm wearing my heart like a crown..."They don't belong here
We might as well let them out they cages 
This whole fuckin' place is about to blow up, right?
Let them mother fuckin' monkeys out
 All we do is grind 
All we do is grind 
Grind my nigga 
I got it, yo
Hey yo, I heard you niggas got robbed , I took it
Got a lot of money in the bank , I don't look it
Used to mix that shit with bakin' soda, he cook it
Had it lookin' like vanilla brownies , then we chop it
I was travelin' through different counties, had to stop it when a nigga got a record deal
Couldn't do it, notoriety was gettin' real
I said screw it, now I'm gamblin' with fifty thousand 
I done blew it, put my dick up in your bitch mouth, let her chew it
Ijust tell 'em who I want dead, he can do it
I don't give a fuck who you know  or who you cool with
I don't fuck with niggas who I know  and went to school with
[Chorus: Sheek Louch &
Styles P

Catch me with a silverback gorilla and a forty-five
Niggas feel mortified fuckin' with the Gods
Ghost is short, nigga, but I hold the fort, nigga
And I always been the wolf, who big dog in the yard?
I give your daughter a bag of water, a bump of cocaine
Don't you ever try fuckin' with the mob
I told Donnie to bring the Tommy, I bust a hunnid shots
'Cause I always been sharp, not a slob
Pour another drink, burn another J
You don't wanna see a dead man turn the other way
'Cause we be on our shit and they be on our dicks
Dead is for your bitch 'cause my niggas livin' rich

And keep weight on the plate, and rep yo' state
If you alone in the streets but your thing hold heat

You sleep on the crew, I'm supposed to be after P
But nowadays I'm a muh'fuckin Monster Cody
Big rims, big whips, nigga big as Brody
Niggas see me, right away they light a big blunt 
Hood niggas love me cause they know it be no front
Sheek make it hot, every day for a whole month
Whatever homebody - stand around if you want
They don't party like they used to cause chicks is nervous
They in the house, they barely bring they kids to service
But me I'm in the club like PARTY OVER HERE!
What what, whatever homey, PARTY OVER HERE!
And I don't really fall into the ice grill
Starin at another man dawg - you gon' pop it or chill?
And you ain't tryin to get rowdy, homeboy sit still
And you don't even know what my man'll do for a bill
Ha ha! Chaos is my middle name
A/k/a Ramon taggin on the middle train
Just a lil' nigga tryin to get a lil' brain
Born and raised, muh'fucker stay in your lane
Aiyyo you know when the Jake come and get all loud 
They stay in the car because we spray crowds
You know where we at, just look for the crowd
Some know Dancer, I just stay with a big ass dutch
That look big enough to cause some cancer 
And I don't even know, who the watch made by
Cause the diamonds hidin the jeweler - one patch on my eye
Suede Ballys like Rick the Ruler

And ridin around half naked in the long-ass mink
I said whatever baby go 'head, make me proud
But - just don't stand there  we spray crowdsNaw I say uh oh, uh oh, uh oh

Phat ass Lui or Gucci or work to hold it
50 thousand big heads kind of hard to fold it
And I don't need needle or threat to say I sold it
Big money, big guns and all that stuff
Black brief case, one wrist handcuff

Like I murdered Vonny, me and Sheek Louch
We can regroup, we can recoupe
We eat leak soup, speed race across country in the mean coupe
We got whips and big chains at the day back routes
Enron money, they say we goin down on tax invasion
Tellin cops if they try to cuff us the max is sprayin
Finally the head in they hats where they badge is layin
On the floor right along where their colleague is prayin
Nigga, this is Theodore and D-Block
Fuck 'round and get your meat chopped
Ease back, whats that all about, huh?
I dare ya'll niggas tryin to play Sheek Louch out
Like I don't find talent like a Yankees Scout
Like I ain't still got it when papi on the drought
The hood got swear tryin to be circle
I don't give a fuck I'll leave a bunch dead Urkels
I don't pillow talk, I'll tell a ho what she need to know
I don't care if she thicker than pizza dough, I'm out standin
I ain't even landin in the same place I use to when I come down high
I wake up wit two bitches in between my thigh
And I ain't hollywood or rich, bitch I ain't Mcky

Lloyd Banks took Fab whole style

We can do this all day and I dont need a breather

You might wanna put the top back on

Back then niggas wanted us to air yall out
I said 'Nah I kinda like what them niggas about'

Walk with a diddy-bop, arm out the hard-top
Leaning like the eighties, Bs on the Mercedes
Piff lit, yelling out some shit to the ladies
Chrome three-eighty, too small to go on my hip
So I just keep it right next to my grip
I'm a B-Boy standing in my B-Boy stance
But I don't breakdance ever since 'One More Chance'
I'm a fly muh'fucker, I do it +BIG+ like that Bed'-Stuy' muh'fucker
Coupe at the Rucker
M.O.P. blasting, yeah 'Blucka Blucka'
I don't throw it back, I'm just cool like that
White tee, white terrycloth, Fila hat
You know the goons is here
You'd think Flex started the car show a little bit early this year
Old Caprices totally gutted
Copped it from an old man, when I got it it was totally flooded
Now this one chick seen it and totally nutted
"Sh-Sh-Sh-Sheek.." that's what she stuttered, haha
I'm an H-double O-D-L-U-M
In the streets but still fly high like Jim

Either way your chances of beating me are slim
I'm not him, please take precaution
Your boy Sheek pull that baby out like an abortion, let's go
Let's go
Two turntables and a mic, let's go
It ain't over till someone fight, let's go
Police come and ruin our night, let's go
Let's go, let's go
Go hoodlums, go thugs
Police thank everyone but men got drugs
Couple of revolvers, clips and some slugs
Sheek watch the news, I know if I'm going for a cruise
The stashbox got a fresh fuse
Apache on him, break beating, bringing it back
Bringing it back, bringing it back, bringing it back
Bringing it back, bringing it back, apache on him
Now its CDs, no vinyl
Sheek go back like the Jeffersons' first +Lionel+
They ask me to spit, I said sure
I had to think what the game missing now, straight up raw
I ain't no backpacker, I'm a clown smacker
A {?} weed-smoking nutcracker
I'm in the hood with bottles
With two hoodrats that could be models, if they lose some weight
But I'm good, a fat ass to me is straight
Old Levi's, five-oh-one, wash 'em one time, they done
Eff it, I got more in the trunk
Next to the Stan Smiths, next to the pump
You hear that bump when it's come on, the crowd jump
Drinks get spilled, the crowd get crunk
I'm back on it, I got straight hood music
Either way you put it, it's all good music, let's goA bunch of pretty girls on the highway

Hehe, I swear to GOD
{Don't push the Mario man!}Started making green when I was sixteen
Grown man shit cause daddy was a coke fiend
Me and my mama struggling through the drama
Bagging up crack I remember my first Llama
Nickel plate nine I remember my first grind
Clapped at a nigga he dropped
I ran up on him grabbed the bag
And met with nigga's down the block
Face no expression I'm filled with all this aggression
Young on the roof I'm cloud testing the Wesson
Then it came time when a kid 
Ma tried to get me to the mosque for a lesson
I was thinking 
To acquire all that it take a couple of bucks
And I ain't have the money to move a couple of ducks
So I put the mask on and robbed a couple of fucks
It's like God sent music to me
He sent it to my mama through the speakers
Then he spoke through Aretha
Curtis May playing
I'm trying to imitate what they saying
Mom told me go to my room
No microphone performing everything with a broom
I was meant to be a star
I was born to pop bottles drive cars
And smoke everything in this cigar
Me and my nigga's is so thorough
We heard about Mary J. Blige but never heard of the borough
We celebrate life like it's new years
We make notes pop like they root beers
We lost nigga's we call those crew tears
You in my dreams but those nightmares
Ruger thoughts, no Kruger thoughts
Now a nigga ball like Jordan shorts
Don Don
Alumni
Hashtag smoke something get high
Hashtag smoke something get highWhat do we do
Ooooooh - what do we do, what do we do
Pressure, pressure - what do we do to do
Let's go
They say they want me to chill
How you rappin is like you sayin to go out and kill
I hear so much of this nonsense
Like brother you a role model, you supposed to rap like you concious
 Even if that was true, understand
I'm a man before anything, rap is what I do
And I'm somebody's father
Like if my baby boy in a jam I won't grab the revolver
Sometimes not even that
I ain't sittin around talkin 'bout slavery is holdin me back
Out East you would think this the Western
I don't mean to be rude, but you can chill with all those silly suggestions
When the pressure is on, your morals is gone
Can't believe your face is torn 
I don't condone it, but I'm willin to loan it
Just relax, go home, hit me up on the horn, got you
For this life... piece of mind
The streets are filled with priiiide
Too young to die, so the bullets fly
The streets are filled with priiiide - pressure, pressure
I know she tryin to be cool for her friends
I know he tryin to front for her in the Benz 
But he ain't watchin where he drivin and drunk 
Hit somebody whip and dude talkin 'bout poppin the trunk
But can't go out like a punk 
Shots go off, and his friends no longer think that he's soft 
Now it's time for the bail
And momma got a slight heart problem cause her son is in jail 
And no one's keepin it real 
The lawyers is riffin, block phone calls, messages skippin
And shorty don't even visit
She too busy in the mall with your re-up money, tryin to live it
When he come out shit he flipped
Cause his son is in the backseat with some other nigga pushin his whip
 This kind of pressure for real
Got at least like 6 out of 10 blacks sittin in jail, damn
This brother comin from work 
9 to 5, minimum wage, his boss is a jerk
He can't stand bein broke 
He get off the bus to get him a beer and somethin to smoke
He think about gettin coke
His family is hungry, it's dead real, no longer a joke
But he ain't made for the streets
This ain't back then, these lil' dudes now carryin heat
Think he can pump where he want, it's the first of the month
Makin mad sales right in the front 
Duke and them gettin mad  things startin to get bad
'Bout to follow homey home to his pad 
But he can't let that ride
He pull out the thing and tell his baby momma go in and hide
 So many put on a stretcher
I'm willin to bet'cha, it's the pressure, c'mon
The streets are filled with priiiiideBe easy, I'm too greasy, you too cute
I will shoot through that suit, through them vapes , through those drapes
At night, well alright, we fuckin'
Who him? He's nothin'
Y'all got kids? They straight
He want you back? Too late
I'm hood but I'm grown
You can stay broke on your own
Got houses, no loans
Vacation spots, no phones
Just my guns and my ones
PS4, the Xbox is my son's
Just some weed and some brown
I was broke as a kid but right now nigga I'm ballin'
Keep it goin' Daisy 
I'm ballin'
Wooooo
I had bapes, I backed up
I was hot in the streets, I racked up
We met Puff, I plaqued up
I got famous like, "bitch back up!"
I'm too cold, check the pulse
Ask about me, any beat, never froze
My niggas major, look at the shows
All that bitch talk, where your hoes?
You say you fresh, where ya clothes?
I heard you trappin' and rattin', who knows?
I stay far, I don't get close
When I see you, just 'what's up,' that's the most
Bad energy, you can keep it
And that money you want to borrow? That's our secret
Just some weed and some brown
I was broke as a kid but right now, nigga, I'm ballin' {*sighing*} Yo let me get a cigarette son
Yeah, fuck it, {?} it's not that serious
Hey yo
She said she all fed up
And she talk about she lea-vin 
Said she won't, be back
'Til we get e-ven 
Said she gon' take, my kids
To her momma's for the wee-kend 
I know she try to be there for me
It's fucked up I got caught cheat-in
Aiyyo, I ain't gon' lie, I got weeded all drunk and I cheated
After the club, shorty gave me what I needed 
That freaky side in the back of a ride
In the back of the park, where we used to hide 
First it was a fling cause I kept her in the wing
She knew I had a wife cause I kept her on my ring
But she ain't even care, she just wanted to be down
And come around the lab when I lay a song down 
And even when I seen her with my lady
She'll walk by, I'll walk by, no actin shady
No prank calls, no baby momma brawls 
Real grown lady like, up in the malls
This whole thing is like way too good
You almost never catch a shorty like that up in the hood 
So I kept it on the hush  brought me a bat line
And called shorty up when it was time to crush
 w/ slightly different ad libs
Aiyyo - couple of Louis bags, the kind that J-Lo has
Could be just lookin at the picture, she don't gotta ask
I like to spend the cash, she like to throw that ass 
I remember when she first flew first class 
I let her push the whip in, until she started flippin
Axin me am I messin with some other chicken
I'm like "WHOA, baby NO NO NO"
This ain't gon' start  and please be smart
You know I got a girl, what'chu care what I do
She like "Fuck you Sheek, whatever, we through" 
Next day she drivin by, smilin and wavin hi
Right in front of my house, what this bitch wanna die?
 w/ slightly different ad libs
Hey yo, yo, I never thought it would go down like this
This bitch got my baby momma suspicious
My door ringin while she doin the dishes
A dozen roses with a note sayin "kiss"
Wait 'til I see this witch
She got me on the couch like a muh'fuckin slouch, I'mma kill this bitch
I'm on AllNightParties dot com
Son lookin at like that's not mom!
 w/ slightly different ad libs
I never thought it would go down like this
Bitch got my baby momma suspiciousMicrophone check, one two
Mic-microphone check, one two 
Microphone check, one two
Mic-microphone check, one two
Microphone check, one two
Mic-microphone check, one two 
Microphone check, one two
Mic-microphone check
Aiyyo Mr. Magic playing, big old boombox
Way before D-Block, a little before LOX
Krush Groove and Beat Street, spell my name out
Fat Boys, remember Disorderlies came out?
I remember Reverend Run was Tougher Than Leather
New laces and he wore the mob hats together
So who's the next Jam Master Jay? Is it Flex? Is it Felli Fel?
Is Hova the next Melle Mel?
Is LOX the new Cold Crush, Furious Four?
New hood mink plus one more
A dying breed, yes indeed
But right now we what Hip Hop needs, aiyyo engineer
Aiyyo cars, fashion, jewelry dripping
What color you wearing, what drink you sipping?
It's a new generation of Hip Hop
Now it's more money involved, so it's Hip Hop
And they expect you to change or get dropped
And you can listen or be mad when your shit flop
I like it though, all that just keep me on
Nowadays they say Sheek got a slick ass tongue
And I ain't old or young, I fit right in between
Still a player but it's only right I made her my queen
You don't come for my Beem', I don't come for yours
Let's get money and do some tours, hey yo engineer
I know well I could sell more with Usher on the hook
Instead I make something to do a juk, look
It's no good without bad
It wouldn't be history if Shan didn't get mad
Listen, niggas battle to say the least
It's life, we go to war, we make peace
And they said that rap was the Devil's play
But it was cool when them boys made 'Walk This Way'
Now look, you got Nelly with Garth Brook, Diddy with the Pussycats
Some rap dudes, different hats
And we ain't going nowhere
Mr. if you got ears, this is all you gon' here, hey yo engineer{Hey Mario}
Yeah!
Sheek Louch nigga
Let the wolves out
Let's go homeboy, let's go homegirl
Let's get it poppin we ain't stoppin this is your world
I talk shit man, grab my dick and
Give these fake niggas pounds with the same hand
Hey yo whattup bitch? Suck or fuck somethin
Hey yo whattup dawg? Stop talkin and buck somethin
No security, I got it everywhere
Places you need your passport I'm heavy there
Nigga Sheek yeah, aight sit there
And while you edit all the tires for your wheelchair
Fuck outta here, I ain't playin wit'chu homey
Besides a few albums, don't none of y'all really know me
Blow somethin, punch a nigga in his face
Clap back, let a muh'fucker know somethin
Nigga all gimmick, e'rything for a buzz to get sales
Ain't none of y'all authentic
I'm in the hood dawg, niggas see me
When the last time you came through on GP
Fuck a in-store, or some kind of tax writeoff
Nigga sit down and take the night off
Burn somethin up, put the glass one down
Go in the store and get a five cent cup
I'm Sheek Louch dawg, fuck album sales
Talk about me say that nigga hard as nails
Fuck a brick, lil' black electrical scales
Better rethink it, and let the shit die
Cause my niggas comin hard I ain't gon' lie
D-Block! D-Block! D-Block! D-Block! D-Block!
{*laughing*}
Aww shit, aww man whatever whatever man
Let's go, D-Block!Lyrics for this song have yet to be released. Please check back once the song has been released.{MARIO!!}
Woo! Sheek Louch nigga 
Grave you with me? 
"Dirty Money" huh? Let's go
The African drum, the runaway slave 
They chained my feet and put me with Grave 
I'm back on my grind, niggas behave 
It's not that I'm stupid, just that I'm brave
They say that I'm mean, they want me to wave
I'm watchin my back as close as you shave
In and out like Jason and Dave 
They shoulda never let a wolf out his cage 
I'm too gully boil
I go back like Fordham Road muslim oil
Chew sticks and shit, two clips and shit, through whips and shit
Rifles that almost got your boy Nixon hit
And I'm not bluffin 
Which one of you turkeys wanna lose stuffin? It's nothin
I'm that cocky  throwback Rocky 
20 Belows, jaw like I play hockey
We can scrap player, fuck rap player
Sheek the hardest on this side the Himalayas
What'chu sayin cuz'? 
Sheek been doin shows with my tale when I only had a street buzz
Now it's big arenas , House of Blueses
Sweep so clean the Knicks keep losin {MARIO!!}
They say my album's sick
Mario laugh because now he can get the streets back on his dick
Hahaha, geah! D-Block {Mario?}
"Dirty Money" muh'fucker, yeah

You know how we do this shit man
Aiyyo Gravy I'm outta here man
Hold that shit downOh, oh...
We gon' do it like - oh, oh... {*repeat 3X*}
We gon' do it like
Sheek usually white tee thuggin, blue steel huggin
See me with a chick, most likely be fuckin
Neighbors too nosy, chain all rosy
Fresh white Airs, one squirt of Dolce
Coupe all kitted, wrist all glitted
You would think I'm hot in how low I wear my fitted
Dutch already twisted, 'gnac all poured
'Bout to hit the hood and find me a nasty broad
I like 'em with some weight, at least around eight
They don't gotta be a 10 long as they can bring a friend
C'mon, pile in, let your hair out
Reach into that little mini-bar and pull a beer out
Loose, there's cranberry if you need it for the Grey Goose
By now I got my pants around my ankles
Ooh c'mere mama, let me thug you out
Let me whisper somethin to you that'll bug you out
45 minutes to Broadway
I can be downtown, I'm only 5 minutes from the Boogie Down
45 minutes to Broadway
We can come back up to Y.O. where I blow your back up
45 minutes to Broadway
We can get drunk ma, and hang out right in the sports bar
45 minutes to Broadway
Or you can fly to New York bitch, the home of this D-Block playa
We like "Take it off!"
Do you mind if I take a picture of you and send it up North?
My homey in his cell and all he got is Black Tail
He need a Polaroid so he can let 'em know it's real 
And you ain't gotta stay indoors
I got a house key for doin the choors 
Chef in the mornin, mines scrambled baby, how you want yours?
 I take 'em to the hood, send 'em to the store
Introduce 'em to my homies, Sheek so raw
It's all fair game, I come back with four more
Don't be scared ma - you heard a lot about D-Block, right?
Well you here ma, let's go
I don't wanna talk about it 
You keep tellin me your house is crowded 
What'chu wanna move in?  I doubt it 
I'll let you sleep over, use the robe and go get you an outfit
I like my freedom baby, I already got a baby
I lay my game down flat soon as I meet a lady
We can do it up, I don't care if you married
Divorced with kids, I don't give a fuck
 - 2X
Oh, oh... we gon' do it like - {*repeat 2X*}Just a kid on his own just tryna get by
Cause his parents not home, cause they out getting high
So he goes to the store tryna steal something fly
But he gets bored, now he's on the juvenile ride
And he's placed in a home, and he talks on the phone
In a whole 'nother world cause he thinks that he's grown
So he comes off the waste and shanks up a face
But little does he know that's a whole 'nother case
That's a soldier, been in every kind of jail
Even taught himself to read, nigga sharp as a nail
He don't smile that much, he don't like to be touched
I mean, a nigga hard, see him out in the yard
Doing fifty a clip, something crazy on the waste
They heater real reason they glued all the plates
Nigga got no fear, every nigga on the tier
From the warden to the guard show him love I swear
He done put in his work, he been working the floor
In the library every day learning the law
So he goes to the board and they let him come home
But gave him parole even though that he's grown
Stay with the hammer, the twenty-two long 
Going to war even though that he's wrong 
Don't give a fuck what side you on 
You ain't his fam 'less you there when he's born 
And he don't care what time it is 
He getting up quick to handle his biz 
Millionaire nigga that's moving that raw 
And you ain't even know he lived next door 
Now the streets ain't the same, it's a whole 'nother game
It's a lotta new names and a lotta new chains
Lil' niggas on the block with pela-pelas
Diamonds in their mouth, sitting on chrome, talking on cellies
Big funny-shaped Benzos, big Lorenzos
Homie getting tired of just rocking his Timbos
Bitches running around with fat asses
Only giving pussy to these niggas with nice-ass glasses
Damn should change, how this pussy nigga get him a Range?
These lil' niggas now working with change
He like 'Fuck that, something gotta give where I live'
These niggas gon' break bread or niggas is dead
That's a soldier
Aiyyo, now he already violated cause his urine is dirty
And he already got a hammer, he just watching a birdy
These lil' niggas don't know the homie seven-thirty
And they don't really don't care, they shoot just as fast
Niggas coming round the block, they better not be ass
Duke a soldier, he tried to tell homie who he was
What he does, laughing, lighting a blunt
These lil' niggas like 'Yeah? Now what you want?'
Showed his gun handle, point the O.G. to candles
Tell 'em that could be him, now beat your Timbs
Homie clapped at 'em, point the MAC at 'em
It's getting crazy now, but fuck it, it's a soldier in townYeah, don't be them
Don't be Jigga, don't be Nas, don't be Kim
Don't be them, don't be 'Pac, don't be BIG
Be yourself for real homie, you that kid

Don't be P, don't be Kiss, don't be Fox'
Don't be 50, don't be Weezy, don't be Slim
Be yourself for real homie, don't be them
Aiyyo, now I ain't gon' sit here and preach to y'all niggas
Like I'm all fucked up and I ain't seeing no figures
But if I had the choice to tell niggas who to be
I'm just keeping it thorough, shit it won't be me
All you see is the fake shit that's on TV
You don't be in the hood when niggas empty three
Court cases, no laces, orange dickies
Jewish lawyer helping you but he cost Gs
Drunk, tryna figure how the hell I'm getting home
Cause ain't nobody left in this, just me and my chrome
D-W-Y'd, I already been tried
So I know the jake watching to see if I abide
Yeah, don't be Swizz, don't be Tim'
Don't be N.O.R.E., don't be Cam, don't be Jim
Don't be them, don't be 'Pac, don't be BIG
Be yourself for real homie, you that kid
Don't be Wade, don't be Moss
Don't be Pun, don't be Crack, don't be Ross
Don't be them, don't be Common, don't be Em
Be yourself for real homie, don't be them
Aiyyo, now everybody got things that going on in their life
From their fake ass friends to their fake ass wife
Money problems, bills due
Niggas scared to turn on the news cause all you hear is who killed who
So you see us at the shows and think that we straight
Niggas tired, I don't remember the last time we ate
Just drinking, smoking, jumping on planes
Trying to be careful of what chick give me brains
There's AIDS out there, and blades out there
Niggas trying to cut you like fades out there
Everything pretty behind the scene
Until you find out your favorite rapper's a fiend
Yeah, don't be Luda', don't be Tip
Don't be 'Face, don't be Usher, don't be Flip
Don't be them, don't be 'Pac, don't BIG
Be yourself for real homie, you that kid
Don't be Sharpton, don't be Jesse
Don't be Kan', don't be Melo, don't be 'Bron
Don't be them, don't be Bush, please not him
But for real little homie, don't be them
Aiyyo, this ain't to down little rappers and crews
I'm just tryna tell niggas that we stressed out too
If you sick, we get sick nigga, flu is flu
You don't know, I don't know nigga, who is who?
Niggas think we just entertainers, and big complainers
You don't know how much shit a day bring us
I'm just saying, ain't no guarantees
Next single you drop just might freeze
You be hot for a minute then you cool on down
Look at rap for years, niggas been passing the crown
I'm just do you homie, don't be him
Don't be me either, fuck that, but don't be them
Yeah, don't be them
Don't be Jigga, don't be Nas, don't be Kim
Don't be them, don't be 'Pac, don't be BIG
Be yourself for real homie, you that kid
Don't be Sheek, don't be LOX
Don't be P, don't be Kiss, don't be Fox'
Don't be 50, don't be Weezy, don't be Slim
Be yourself for real homie, don't be them
Yeah, don't be Swizz, don't be Tim'
Don't be N.O.R.E., don't be Cam, don't be Jim
Don't be them, don't be 'Pac, don't be BIG
Be yourself for real homie, you that kid{M-M-Mario?}
Aiyyo Poobs hit me nigga 
Okay! 
Fuck it son, let's go in
Aiyyo clickety clank, that "Piggy Bank" shit is garbage
I thought it'd be harder than that
I thought G-Unit niggas worked harder than that
I mean most of the shit, that I'm hearin is wack
Young Buck hang on lah, I like the dude
But it's war and any day I'll eat your food
Lloyd Banks took Fab whole style, like you ain't know
All you missin is his chipped tooth smile
And homey I ain't never gon' respond to you
I don't care what you say or what the fuck you do
You don't deserve no raps 
Take your old ass home and take a nap, you garbage nigga
Ha ha, y'all not scary, don't the artists come from Yonkers
I know you wasn't talkin 'bout Mary 
You diesel fags, stay in the car
And go G-G-G-G, all day in your sports bra
I'm in the hood dick
'Member the place you used to come to, when your shit went brick
 Before Eminem ever heard the shit you kick
When you could walk around without none of your clique
I don't care about your money dawg, no hatin either
We can do this all day and I don't need a breather
I want you to shut us down, how that sound?
My name too strong you clown
Guaranteed it's the can of worms
You might wan' put the top back on, 'fore your ass get germs
Back then niggas wanted us to air y'all out
I said nah I kinda like what them niggas about
Before I knew about the rattin
Before you locked up half of Manhattan, Irv and his boys
Before you ran around in them bulletproof toys
I thought you was a "Problem Child"
I see niggas turn bitch when the shit get wild, ha ha
Yo ten mill' nigga, or twenty mill' sold 
You 'bout to lose the niggas that's gold
I explode on homey
I like bein out but I unload on homey, let's keep this peace dawg
Cause you and me both got them big ol' heats dawg
Hahahaha
That's how you rap right?
Fuck outta here nigga
Your shit garbage B

Aiyyo Game, whattup my nigga?
You know what it is already
Henchmen whattup daddy?

Heh, let's goThis beat is to be used, violently - weapons not included
Double platinum never; still on the grind though
Playin my position, watchin behind though
D-Block'd out, must I remind yo
Benjamins walk with me, two guns y'all can see
Money pile, wild out, nigga who want what
Every year it's somethin new for you to shake your butt
Get on yo' strut, you feelin me soldier?
Ten hun  ten years strong, the record is long
Coulda been a lil' richer if I rocked a thong
Anyway; the Coupe is gray
Sheek startin to get hot in the hood like the month of May
My dog tags tangle, white tee on
Paul Wall bottoms, big Jacob bangle
One dutch of evil and piney
Matter fact, gimme some 'gnac and I'mma chase that with a Heine'
And make sure you pour some for my thugs behind me 
Hustle 'til the sun up 
Keep comin 'til you come up 
E'rybody keep your gun up 
Run up you gon' die like the beeper call
Dawg this is Styles, I ain't Nas but I "Ether" y'all
You should hide when you see that ride creep along
Cause it's on when the doors open - shut his lights out
He got his mans, but I'm fuckin get 'em all coffins
Lil' niggas is now mine they swallow the barrel find it
Bet that'll open 'em up 
And they all act tough, 'til you pokin 'em up
Nigga - run up like you came for a marathon
Body's in the suitcase, head's in the carry-on 
You food to a real nigga, rude with the steel nigga
Give a fuck; you shoulda chilled nigga 
All I know is puttin in work
Get the new M-5, nigga put in the work
Crack a vanilla dutch, nigga put in the earth
Run up I keep the gun up, get put in the earth - what?
M-6 revvin, all black on the cell phone
And all that like I'm talkin to Devon 
Shorty wanna hang out of the car 
Yellin out money ain't a thang, holdin up a mayonnaise jar
Of that stick-ickalous, ridiculous
Comin down Harlem, foggin up the whole St. Nickalous 
Red monkies on them pretty things
Wipin off ash, showin Scado my Diddy things
Pay attention  gon' miss if I squench in
Just us bein there is causin tension
No beef, no wreath nece', it get real messy
Pull a rifle on you boys like Uncle Jesse
I'm Sheek baby girl, one third of the LOX
Put you in the mink and out of the fox
Added a Honda into the box
Earring holes is stretched from the size of the rocks
Let's go{*helicopter flies overhead*}
There comes a time, in every man's life
When he gon' have to decide, who he fuckin with
Who you fuckin with?  Them niggas don't care about you
Them niggas don't give a fuck about you
Why you rappin like that?  This street music!
Yo, let's, talk about it what; Sheek can throw
The fiend on a nigga guarantee he won't walk up out it
No no, nickel-plated uhh; kinda old
But the muzzle them usin make this motherfucker updated
Puh-puh, nigga please; if a nigga had your son
And had him lookin down you wouldn't even squeeze
Uh uhh, I don't know; I don't wanna hear about
The money that you had, or what you did a long time ago
Yo yo the hood is mine; I don't gotta sell a lot
I just live off more points than the porcupines
Uh uhh, feel me cousin?  Sheek been a problem
Before this D-Block shit started buzzin
Some are sayin - no he wasn't, he turned sick
With that women in your family can suck my dick
And I've been red hot every since; I ain't sayin I'm the best
Muh'fucker, I'm just workin with some sense
This is that blood, crip, latin king shit, every hustler pushin a whip
Street music - what?  {*repeat 4X*}
This is that blood, crip, latin king shit, every hustler pushin a whip
Street music - what?  {*repeat 4X*}
Y'all niggas so sweet, Sheek so street
From the doo rag on my head to the sneakers on my feet
The heart in my chest, black on my flesh
And I swear to my son, I'll leave this shit a mess
I do it for the yard, where most of my squad
Is sittin in a cell, goin through hell
And every frontin nigga got a story to tell
Bye bye nigga, doves fly nigga
The hardest nigga spittin came from Bed-Stuy nigga
After that was Sheek, some say it was Jigga
I got loyalty; I ain't a king to none of this shit
But I swear, on the streets I'm royalty
Kinda scary ain't it?  You don't wanna be
That's why the hood treat you colder than the A&P
I throw my fists up - but it ain't for black power
It's for any motherfucker that gets up
Niggas don't wanna buh-bug bang with me
Cause 9 out 10 when you see me I got the muh'fuckin thangs with me
Fuck it put 'em up; muh'fucker put your guns in the air
If you with me nigga hold 'em up
Ruh ruh rowdy ain't it; I ain't afraid to go to war
And have a nigga white tee, like you fingerpaint it
Every hood got 'em, kinda hard to spot 'em
Once I'm there about to tell you what nigga shot him
What the fuck is up?  I ain't nuttin up
Niggas hard 'til they leakin through they button up
Get at my crew, whatever nigga who
You don't need a flight to be all JetBlue
Understand me nigga - if it happens, it happens
But I ain't really a Grammy nigga
Sheek spit rage; y'all don't want me to win nuttin
I'm bringin the whole Block on the stageWww.youtube.com/kaddasheekoffBeg and borrow for your life God
Kissing they ass you hoeing for your life God
Money got low you bout to sell your ice God
Music industry treading water
Was on top now you barely can feed your daughter
Law and order album sales out the rectum
So next time what they offer you is disrespectful
Even though you hotter than the past summers
It's too bad all the labels see is big numbers
Wifi vision on the game yo In the hood
They got vision on your chain bro Is she on your dick still
Or is she ducking your calls with Taequan in the mall
Laughing at your instagram pic getting high sucking his dick
In his whip playing your shit reality is brutal
You ain’t saved a dime cuz u ain’t used your noodle
You back in the hood now
I could find you and I ain’t have to Google
Is you legendary first class of secondary
Is you executive level or are you secretary
Is the hating on them young boys necessary
If you a G let it be that
You know they watching let them little niggas see that
If you a G let it be that
You know they watching let them little niggas see that
You know they watching let them little niggas see that God
It’s like you fresh out the penitentiary
Everything changed bottles ain’t complimentary
Where them songs on the radio at
Why them DJ’s ain’t calling you back
He was a mixtape how he got it like that
Now you mad at the younger Gods the new talent emerge
You feel it’s nothing that they put in their words
But so what Is Jordan mad at Kobe Is Kobe mad at Bron
That’s life you pass the baton but read the Quran, embrace it and bond
Take em to a level you on and then you’ll be considered a don
But this ain’t about me this a song about the OG bredrins
Thats considered as legends
Is you legendary first class of secondary
Is you executive level or are you secretary
Is the hating on them young boys necessary
If you a G let it be that
You know they watching let them little niggas see that
If you a G let it be that
You know they watching let them little niggas see that
You know they watching let them little niggas see that GodHey yo B.G., pass my drink my nigga
We gon' try this one more time
I'm back motherfuckers, get the mac muh'fuckers
Pull it out the trunk, clack clack muh'fuckers
I told y'all to "Walk Witt Me," dropped somethin sick on it
And I ain't put no one but my motherfuckin clique on it 
No R&B, I ain't have no muh'fuckin chick on it
These other niggas songs, jail niggas beat they dick on it
Now I got a couple guests; friends, got a couple less
I don't give a fuck, my bullets goin through a couple vests
This ain't rehearsal; you TV, I'm DVD bitch
What I'm sayin is ain't no commercial
I came to stomp shit out, drive by or get out
Got a lil' money but, I'm used to bein without
So act like I won't put your face on the side of Chase
Then take your Bass right off your little designer waist
Can beat you with the hands, but I'm packin just in case
Dice game, niggas sweatin, hopin that I ace
Real niggas fuck with me, thank you if you stuck with me
Now the whole hood, screamin out a nigga company
D-B, L-O-C-K
Still got the turntables right next to the instant replay
First I let you get to know me, now this one here
I'ma let you bitches get to blow me, talk to 'em slowly
Fuck bein humble, and fuck the sophomore jinx
I been around since the Benjamins was in the Tunnel
It ain't changed, I seen niggas turn Bryant Gumbel
After that, I done wild out and didn't fumble
I even threw two guns up like I was in the jungle
You will now board, flight number 3-5-4
First class hip-hop, and we landin in hardcore
The music niggas pray to they God for
Y'all niggas judge it yourself
But if you soft and don't do dirt, this music might be bad for your health

You just sitting on your broke fat ass complaining
And you wonder why you here unless you running the train
Ain't getting money with them big boys that's heavy in 'caine
How you think the True Religions and the Jimmy Choo came?
How you think your little man got the XBox game?
Get money bitch, get your head did

Trey-eighty on the bus coming back with the lady
Tailored Greyhound and a yankee-colored Mercedes

And I still got a fan base, rap or not
Fresh out the pot, nigga, I still got a fan base

Woo! D-Block bitch 
 Let's goWu Block
Ayo Ghost I'm about to go in right here son
Yo there's no place to hide, tints on the window
Three fifty-seven pointed out the ride, treat 'em like a dutch
Dump his insides, blood on the door, blood on the floor
They ready for the battle I'm prepared for the war
Money on stupid, soldiers on call
Follow you for real, chase niggas through the mall
Rolls on the table I'll show you how to ball
Don don I blow weed on the weave with no shirt on I got tricks up my sleeve
Suffocate flow make it hard to breathe, I don't want that bitch I'm just that hard to leave
Yea, you see the goons that I bring, D-Block chillin' with the wallaby king
My Staten Island niggas they gon' let that shit ring, my dudes locked up hold it down in the bing
Police think I'm carrying like every kind of drug, I just say what's up, no dap, no hug
I just keep it movin', I see they all fake but they don't really want beef they like Common Sense and Drake
Ayo yo Ghost check this out right, I just killed one of your classics
It's only right you kill one of mines, you got me son?
Let's go
When Nas made one love I was on the bench still
Mask on, contemplating a kill with one glove
In deep thought, paper bag cover my o.e
Heard they got long nickels slangin' the four deep
Uh, Medina niggas, Gowanus and Park Slope
Mad heavy, cashmere low coats
Pumpin' at the joy spot, stepped to this fiend
Served him from Queen, he had a nose like Floyd Pops
Armed him with a trey deuce, tell him to knock twice
Tell 'em you want two, show 'em your nice bike
The door knob turned, somebody cracked it
Bernard walked in, I'm right behind him with the all black ratchet
Surprise bitches, welcome to Staten
The first nigga that flinched I blast him, the fiends laughing
Foot locker bags unwrapped raw, stacks on the table
The nigga I shot beginnin' to crawl, he in his boxers
Seen the ounce on the plate with oxys, baggin' up mad shake
Yo B, yo watch him, while I search the fridge, cabinets and the back room
Half a brick in the grits box and the vacuum
Drugs is what we all about, cash and it's all around
Tell them niggas to get on they face and pat 'em down
I got the goods let's be out son, slingin' of a nigga head
Word to everything they get out done, let's kill these niggasAyo light it up nigga, where that liquor at?
They said you should be thankful for what you got
I said, you should be thankful for what I'm not
If this was 'Back Then Sheek' , niggas is getting shot 
Running through these streets like I'm homeless
Single parent, my momma couldn't condone this
I was broke, but I felt like I should own this
Young nigga, thoughts of getting paid
I was around bad bitches, thoughts of getting laid 
Still indictments king, houses getting raid
Niggas straight snitching, the coke was getting weighed.
Looking at the Aston, my little niggas was blasting
Imagine not eating for a full month, like we fasting
But Allahu Akbar from a cop car
Hoping they won't  shoot a popular rap star
Shooting, but love the scuffle
Money in a Louis duffle
Range Rover, what a couple
Hating, you don't like me? Fuck you
Love when I be acting up
Hammer out back them up
Bring his chain on the block, my niggas be cracking up.
Yeah I'm on my bullshit, .38 revolver hoe
Smoke weed,  drink, pop percs, like they're Tylenol.
Getting money since a kid, before I signed a record deal
Puff seen it in my eyes, LOX niggas real, for real
Battled everybody, stand outside with the shotty in the bushes
Knew the dope fiends and the addicts and the pushers
Ten years in the game, ten years with the same
D-Block, LOX, a household name
I ain't had a pot to piss in
But a lil' nigga listen, so I figured I be getting some dough
Grew up on the block, cocaine rock, dope and weed spots
Them shooting niggas letting it go 
But I love it, I always say that I'll rise up above it
But the streets keep pulling me in 
You can't be mad at me for trying to win.
How the fuck did I love this?
Running all these red lights
Auntie in the crib, half asleep, with a hundred brick stacked under her right
Never been the same, since he held his first pack
Put it in a little nigga hands, show them how to work that
Eating shrimp scampi with scallions and medallions on
Cubans on the dinner plates, sculpture with them lions on them
Bracelets, all my shooters in Asics
Blunt rats, so hammers in their holsters, wasted
Political killers, with digital pillars till my bro's butt naked in the box, don't daylight feel us?
Made the board as soon as he put down appealing
Got that nine record longer than a mess hall ceiling
Outdoors, still squirting in the mouth of whores
BMF credit dirty, lawyers still vouching for us
Safe deposit boxes, sharp oxes
Murder you, have your dick hanging out your boxers
I ain't had a pot to piss in
But a lil' nigga listen, so I figured I be getting some dough
Grew up on the block, cocaine rock, dope and weed spots
Them shooting niggas letting it go 
But I love it, I always say that I'll rise up above it
But the streets keep pulling me in 
You can't be mad at me for trying to win
How the fuck did I love this?
Yeah! D-Block! Woo!Lyrics for this song have yet to be released. Please check back once the song has been released.Let's go baby
Uh, y'all know who the fuck it is 
I'm from Yonkers, but overlooking the Brooklyn Bridge 
Lighting up sour underneath the Eiffel Tower
I'm like Van Halen bungee jumping in New Zealand 
What a better feelin' than chillin' with your crew around you? 
Without money, loyalty is what it come down to 
I don't know, but you can feel it when it's your time to go 
Before he died he looked at me and said "I love you, bro" 
I'm like, "Cool, but what's all this soft shit fo'?" 
He said, "I smell you, but I don't care, I just thought I'd tell you" 
Later on I hear the mothafuckin' sirens and yellow tape 
And all these bitches started cryin' 
Let the church say amen 
I'ma load this 10 and put the bandana on and ride for my friend 
They say it's stupid, but I don't give a fuck
Matter fact, pull over, let this pussy out my truck 
Buck-buck-buck, take that with you on the way down 
No names, I suggest all of y'all just stay down 
Never seen a man cry until we seen his kid die 
Scarface voice, gorilla shit that I live by 
Code of the streets, now everybody don't abide 
Bus stop niggas, everybody want a ride
Niggas need bail, now everybody wanna hide 
How the fuck you gonna tell me how the fuck I feel inside? 
With no social media, niggas won't exist 
300 followers, no wonder why you pissed 
Still for Trayvon, I put up my right fist 
Still for Trayvon, I put up my right fist
My fallen soldiers, nigga

Paul Wall bottoms, big Jacob bangle
One dutch of evil and piney

Ha
Hell

We live the life that is diamonds and guns
We can go loud or we could pop with them silencer one
I threw my first hammer running from the boys
Then I went and got a stash box and all of my toys
Now I keep a little shooter that will take that
If I tell him, he'll show up where you wake at
Try to offer me some time, my nigga ate that
When it get rocky, my niggas move, ASAP
We come through, niggas look extra rich
Having fun, popping bottles, nigga, watch your bitch
Jealous niggas get taken care of
I ain't saying that you soft, but my niggas, you're fully aware of
Loyalty, grown, mad kids to feed
Semi-automatics, ya niggas will bleed
Twelve in the head, the headlines will read
Every show I do cause a stampede
Now look, I used to bag up in the plastic
Whoever thought We Are The Streets will be a classic?
We calm down before you get your ass kicked
And I'm still strapped, you ain't even got to ask it
Hold up, ain't no such things as halfway crooks
The Mobb said it best back then
I guess you new rapping niggas wasn't listening
But I don't judge 'em, I still play it
They ask me how I feel about it, I OK it
I'd be looking like a hating nigga if I say it, so I chill
Shoutout to all my street niggas loving that real
The foundation, heavy anticipation, SBG2

I don't even know these niggas hangin in front
Usually we woulda been asked them what do they want
What they came here for, this is 354
What you tryna get some gas or some shit from the store
But nobody asked these motherfuckers what do they want
It was bitin, mad traffic, the first of the month
It was me, Chep, Bizzy and Hit
B. G. And Lickalone and yeah I think Earth was there and shit
And a few other niggas in and out of the buildin
Tryin to catch every sell but not to children
Got a sixty of that yack in the store in the back
Chep about to go home and get more of his pack
Jake ain't fuckin wit us, what's the miracle
Niggas moms ex heads now turn spiritual
Wanna preach to us talk about Christ
And how fuck sand, how he could bring the beach to us
That's when I noticed niggas still outside
Hoody on with some shades like they tryna hide
So I cocked the hammer then I walked to 'em
No beef, just a friendly little talk to 'em

Niggas comin out the house with the hitchelin under the michelin
Throwin back a clip or two
You would think we went to war with Colin Powells crew
Police comin now but we don't give a fuck

And they ain't really wit us, niggas really tryna get us

Burner under the seat, so when I stop short, the gun slide
Police next to us, got us looking all petrified
They ain't even want us, wasn't even looking
Later, I laughed about it like "I wasn't even shooken"
Didn't even have beef then, but still had the burner down in Arlington
At the  key for the weekend
Nigga get the drinking, then nigga get the blasting
I love that fast money, boy, the rapping was the last thing
I knew we had a gift though, high school, bang on the lunch table
And let my partner kill 'em with the Kiss flow
Been fly from the get go, I thought it was dope
I sold the fiend soap and brought me a Canal Street rope
I had the pele pele, avirexes, , and bear coat
Lil shorty in the projects, all she like to do is deep throat
Spit it in the sink and come and ask me for a c-note
Her friend tried to fuck me, her man tried to fight me
I shot at that nigga, feds tried to indict me
I was this close to telling my real niggas got to write me
Instead, I write this song, salute to the dead
I got some yak and some sour, I'm just clearing my head
Nigga, we let the smoke burn like we Dali Lamas

Raised in the crack epidemic, 
So we thought making drug money looked cool
All I really wanted was to act 
With a goose with good feathers
On some new leathers and some dime bags
Drink a 40 ounce just to watch time pass
For the Dutch days nigga, get a wipe out
Never wave the white flag, never throw a white towel
From the bomb squad, all them niggas rhyme hard
Any letter scrap, get drunk and blow the tromb god
A bunch of little niggas that be running around
And they got organised, start running the town
Felt good to see 100s around, thousands around
And every time I rhyme, niggas crowding around
Yeah I'm the quiet one, the loudest aroundYeah, it's a new beginnin'
But e'rything still the same
If you love it in the hood, my niggas, then say 
If you like getting money, my niggas, then say 
If you running from them boys, my niggas, then say 
But your guns is out 'cause you gon' have to catch me 
If you love it in the hood, my niggas, then say 
If you like getting money, my niggas, then say 
If you running from them boys, my niggas, then say 
But your guns is out 'cause you gon' have to catch me 
I got my back all in it, D-Block inside
Got my Mac all in it, I ain't leave it in the ride
See my face wolf a nigga, no barber, no shower
Just heavy pushin' nigga, mad weed and liquor
We don't hide from you homie, we just get up and we go
One cigarette, orange juice, one butter roll
E'rybody know my name, bitches on my dick
Police loopin' back around 'cause they think they slick
'Cause I got heavy ammunition, three birds on the seat
But I'm just goin' here to there, I ain't tryna draw heat
'Cause I got somethin' on my waist, somethin' under the hood
Motherfucker I'm good for a high speed chase, tell 'em
If you love it in the hood, my niggas, then say 
If you like getting money, my niggas, then say 
If you running from them boys, my niggas, then say 
But your guns is out 'cause you gon' have to catch me 
If you love it in the hood, my niggas, then say 
If you like getting money, my niggas, then say 
If you running from them boys, my niggas, then say 
But your guns is out 'cause you gon' have to catch me 
I'm a money go-getter, you a light dough spender
I'm Barry Bonds of rap, you ice cold nigga
County on my ass, feds and the task
Caprice, doin' a hundred but only 80 on the dash
Pounds in the trunk, burner and a brick
Too $hort bitches on my Oakland shit
I got love in the hood, for my thugs in the hood
Got my bottom bitch with me, she got the snub in the hood
Niggas talk reckless, I tell 'em "Boy listen here
You gon' need more than magic to make me disappear"
System in the Caprice, soundin' all crystal clear
Knockin' Silverback , frontin' like we switchin' gears
If you love it in the hood, my niggas, then say 
If you like getting money, my niggas, then say 
If you running from them boys, my niggas, then say 
But your guns is out 'cause you gon' have to catch me 
If you love it in the hood, my niggas, then say 
If you like getting money, my niggas, then say 
If you running from them boys, my niggas, then say 
But your guns is out 'cause you gon' have to catch me 
Black tops, red tops, clear backs, E pills
Ranges, Coupe DeVilles, comin' through on big wheels
Hat low, my niggas rowdy as they wanna be
Blunt lit, stupid bitch, get from in front of me
Sheek Louch homie, now I got a street buzz
Song's hot, just like when "Everyday I'm Hustlin" was
Down South heavy but New York is where I rest at
White tee, hover mu'fuckers wear a vest at
Late night, pop the trunk, party over here, hoe
Drink up, smoke some', that's what it's there for
Hood love, love that, love money, love rap
Love fiends who love crack, dope boy and all that
If you love it in the hood, my niggas, then say 
If you like getting money, my niggas, then say 
If you running from them boys, my niggas, then say 
But your guns is out 'cause you gon' have to catch me 
If you love it in the hood, my niggas, then say 
If you like getting money, my niggas, then say 
If you running from them boys, my niggas, then say 
But your guns is out 'cause you gon' have to catch me 
Hahaha, ah...Paint the picture of a genius
45 on my waistline
Interstate sign
Bow down to Donny
Niggas get scared when they see me behind the weal of that Mozerati
In a strugglin circle
Blowin purple
You niggas hurtin
I don't give a fuck
Don't give a fuck, go cop me another truck
Hit you with the hammer, have you stuck
What block you from?
What block you from?
Check the seenery, plastic and rubber bands rapped around my greenery
My energy crazy
Soon as I walk up in the club, my jewelry drippin on me like I just stepped out the tub
So fresh, so clean, that's why I'm so cocky
Rocky body, I get the bitch to give me coffee
These motherfuckers can't stop me
Where my shooters at? we them dope boys
We the weed killers, make some noise
Money? I get it
Pussy? I get it
Cars? I get it
Where my shooters at? we them dope boys
We the weed killers, make some noise
Loso
Drug dealing weather, hoodie under the leather
The weed without steze, birds with no feathers
Your beef is mine, we loading guns together
My goons ride, we give it to whoever
Fuck getting by there, hood is getting dry
Come with tricks out of town, have my Mack sittin high
The streets is talkin, niggas die over words
So don't understate anything you overheard
The young shooters will kill something if you don't buy lunch
6 piece wings, hot fries, and a whole fruit punch
That's why I gotta move like a rich nigga
Might be with a nigga's bitch, but never with a bitch nigga
We all know the ones, who'd be hood if they could
And they got them girls who think they too good for the hood
So all I can do is keep a c note
Cause it's goin down, and the streets is a steep slope
Where my shooters at? we them dope boys
We the weed killers, make some noise
Money? I get it
Pussy? I get it
Cars? I get it
Where my shooters at? we them dope boys
We the weed killers, make some noiseOoh, shit 
That boy-that's a bad mother
Gangsta shit, nigga
Move out-move out of his way
Dayzel, let 'em out
That's thirty G
Uh, back on the block, loaded Glock in the bushes 
Couple workin' niggas but mostly be with them pushers
Niggas pullin' up askin' where the coke or kush is
Flower in her pussy take it out when she douches
Different breath on this track
Different gunner with me now, he shoot left with the MAC
Nothin' shiny when he clap, prefer that shit in black
I let the wolves eat the sheep, I just tell 'em where they at 
Couple dollars and some real estate
Jealous niggas eat a dick 'cause I'm too real to hate
Me and my wife havin' lunch at the Garden State
Side bitch blowin' me up but she gon' have to wait
Everything I did, you know crime was in it
Rollie on my wrist but ain't no diamonds in it
Fuck a bust down, I'm too grown for that
Lawyer pickin' up the phone, he like, "What now?"
Think I give a fuck what they say outside?
Nigga, it's a reason that they stay outside
I be everywhere but move like I'm tryna hide
I be everywhere but move like I'm tryna hide
Nigga
[Break: Heroin Pop &
Sheek Louch
]
This motherfucker, oh
Shit, can I borrow a dollar?
Come on, baby
My veins hurt, baby, I need more of that shit
I'm goin' back in, nigga
Shyeah
They say the early bird, he get the worm
Niggas fuckin' raw until they get the germ
Cipher 'til you realize you smokin' sherm
Lessons that these lil' niggas have to learn
Before the bookie, we was throwin' dice
Broke, we missed Christmas over Kwanzaa twice
Got some money then we back to Santa
Got some work and I'm back in Atlanta
I chop it up if I knew you a while
Besides that, I don't give a fuck 'bout what numbers to dial
I shake hands when we meet, don't expect me to smile
I get the bag and go home, I'm protectin' a child
I don't care where you from
I put the sticks on these niggas like Questlove's drum
Get in the Hellcat and floor it 'til the muffler hum
Used to hang out a lot but now that shit sound dumb 
Misery love company, still
We all eatin', couple thousand? Just pass me the bill
Club promoter's gettin' nervous, he asked me to chill
I told him stay outside with it, my niggas is real
Done
Any one of these niggas move, I got you, Louch
You go on ahead and enjoy yourself
You want me to wash your car while you in there?
Yeah, I'll wash it
I know it's rainin', nigga, I don't give a fuck
I got you
Yeah, so, I told this nigga look, man, this both our bitches
It ain't just yours
Wait, hold on, my client is here
Hey, Sheek, what's up, nigga?
Yeah, your car is ready to go, nigga
How was the club?
Yeah, come on, you gon' hold me down or what, baby?
Where all your bitches at?
You tryna tell me not one bitch is on your dick tonight?
Oh man, it's okay, sometimes you gotta go home and rub one out
Yeah, it's okay to be aloneSmoke weed in my old school
Candy paint drippin from my old school
I can touch the sky in my old school
My old school drive better than your new school
I done had everything, from bikes to trucks to mopeds
Leanin in the front, lookin good, untill I seen these old heads
67 73s, candy painted SRTs
Race stripes from the front to the back, who want it? me
I be rollin up in the 4 door, these women want my photo
That make them haters mad, I keep that same mojo
Sticky burner's pack, you don't know what car is that
All you know that's Donny G's, shorty with him, ass is fat
Check that, gonna valay park it, roll it and spark it
VIP see me, I'm the hottest thing on the market
Candy drippin, extra flippin, Rosay or Patrone sippin
Go pro, I got the Mercedes, but I think I want the Rolls though
Smoke weed in my old school
Candy paint drippin from my old school
I can touch the sky in my old school
My old school drive better than your new school
Man, I'm a parking lot pimper, a candy car flipper
A wood grain gripper, and a conjur sipper
No Conture leather, we stitchin on the nose
Great Concore drippin, I'm sittin on them 4s
Got the doors of a butterfly, straight out the cacoon
Smokin dro and no butter, the trunk is goin boom
Better make room for my elbos, I'm about to throw them hoes
Comin down on 44s, shittin on you, hold your nose
I'm so composed, and I'm so relaxed
I'm blowin dro, plus I'm blowin stacks
So hold your back, don't try to front
Get up out the way, we about to stunt
Smoke weed in my old school
Candy paint drippin from my old school
I can touch the sky in my old school
My old school drive better than your new schoolWhat's up kids?
What's goin' on man, what yall doin'?
Can yall do a favor, can yall do a favor for Uncle Louch huh?
You can?
I need yall to sing the hook for me one time, real fast. Ok?
Take away all the hate and the pain 
Ayo, Fuck it let them hate
I walk around with this heavy ass revolver but
Today I feel featherweight
If you ain't thinkin' bout going all out
And running down south, homie close your mouth
They don't want to fight
They just talking all night
Let them hate, i know i'm doing something right
And I'ma continue to blow up
Make niggas throw up, until you little niggas grow up
Yeah, I got just what you're lookin' for
The pump will leave a nigga dead at the liquor store
Yeah, you get sprayed on the kitchen floor, tied to the oven door
Dog what the bitchin' for?
Shit, it gotta be somethin' else to do
Get off my dick and find you a bitch to screw
Homie, somethin' gotta give
Before I come into the place where you live and...
Hook It's the dance step, it's the BOUNCE!
 Gotta make sure I don't spill my drink on this
 Ha ha ha ha! It's the swagger
G's up homey
I'ma get money, get money
I don't care if your peoples act funny
I'ma go loco, straight loco
Aiyyo mamis pass the trey-ocho
Cause we do it, straight do it
You coulda came with us ma but you blew it
Make it hot boo, bring your friend too
And drop it like you supposed to, ah-HA!
You know what this is lil' momma
You could walk around with the top of a pajama
Boxers on, pillow case over the llama
Drama; I deal with more weed than a farmer
Point blank, dot dot, period, comma
 So gritty, but still so pretty
Broke and I get as much pussy as Diddy
Ante up, catty all candied up
I'm on ice like I just won the Stanley Cup
Yup! Stay booted up, a little 'gnac in the cup
About to score, the homey had to shoot it up
 23's, low pros on top of a flatbed
 Niggas think I just got towed - nope!
To the car show, Murciélago
Hammer in the cargo - what's my name? 
Sheek Louch that boy there 'bout to change the game
Aiyyo; I ain't gon' lie, it's a lot of things I can't buy
But if I really want it bad  and really get mad 
I'ma grab the strap like a muh'fuckin dad
To get what I want, if it take me a month
And pitch my lil' pieces right in the front
Smoke my blunt, and drink my 'gnac
And watch my back like I'm under attack 
A lot of people think I don't like their ass
Guess what?  I really don't like their ass
And won't hesitate to put somethin in you fast 
So you can go 'head with that bullcrap
Cause I don't mean rhymes when I say I ain't afraid of a murder rap
Aiyyo - she said she love my flow, and the things that I say
And how the rest of my crew is so caliente
You D-Block boys really know how to play 
When the next LOX album, I'm just waitin for the day
Look Range, Bent' Coupe, house, indoor hoop
Chain got enough karats to put in grandma soup
I ain't in the loop, I'm nowhere near you
I'm in the hood dawg where them peoples scare youI got that type of pussy
Warm pussy, that's what I got
Yeah, she loves me
She loves me not
So, what's up?
Wet ass mouth, deep motherfuckin' throat
She loves me, she loves me not
Deep ass throat, bet your bitch can't go there
Hey, come over here, baby
She-she went on and on, she kept on
Got down on her knees and sucked my dick until it's gone 
Said my name is Donnie but she liked to call me Sean 
Since I got with Puff, I been scorin' like LeBron 
Balenciagas on, smellin' like Yves Saint Laurent
Just came from the gym, still a kitty, got no smell
Pussy stay wet with no K-Y jell
If I'm in the streets or I'm locked up in the cell
She gon' come and get me 'cause I always kept it real 
She wanna bring her friend, I told her long as she looked good 
I don't want no boujee bitch, I want some chick up out the hood 
This bond that we got is understood 
My bitch go on and on and on, she kept on 
Yeah
Warm pussy, that's what I got
Yeah, she loves me
She loves me not
So, what's up?
Wet ass mouth, deep motherfuckin' throat

She loves me, she loves me not

Suck it like you Jill Scott while I'm recordin' the shit 
Brew up a couple bags of some  and some other shit
Shorty look so god I suck on her mother clit 
On they could get away with sayin' that other shit
Niggas know what I'm talkin' 'bout, I'm not gonna discuss the shit 
She like it in her ass too, she a disgustin' bitch
She pulled my dick out her ass and tried to suck the shit 
I pulled my dick out her mouth like, yo, you buggin', bitch
Rinse your mouth, let me wipe off, you on some other shit
'Bout to take a number on her like that Biggie skit
This bitch wanted me to do it, she really with the shit
Whoa

Deep ass throat, bet your bitch can't go there
Yeah

That's what I got 
What's up? Riding on the freeway, chacin money everyday
And I don't care, no, I could stay in the house all day
I stood outside with overtime
I rep my city all the time
Young niggas we came up doin crime
Oh, you thought niggas just was rappin
Till you came outside, and they was clappin
See nothing, I don't know what's happening
Everything I drop, that shit be slappin
Fuck lotto, Imma catch a lick
After this bottle, she goin get this dick
You can have her back, I make it quick
All this money made them niggas sick
See that Rolli, that's a 50 piece
That other bitch, that's his other neese
The lil one, grab my other piece
He a goon, I'm another beast
Riding on the freeway, chacin money everyday
And I don't care, no, I could stay in the house all day
I stood outside with overtime
I rep my city all the time
Young niggas we came up doin crime
I ain't call you back cause you bor me
Her pussy, that's another story
Like my first Nintendo or Atari
Throw the dice, like I play Monopoly
In the club, when I first saw yo face
No way, I made millions with my nigga Puffy
Did it again with my nigga Wonndy
All this weight, no jet ski
Got a nine inside my Mozerati
If I fuck with you, I do it for free
Riding on the freeway, chacin money everyday
And I don't care, no, I could stay in the house all day
I stood outside with overtime
I rep my city all the time
Young niggas we came up doin crime{M-M-Mario?}
Aiyyo Poobs hit me nigga 
Okay! 
Fuck it son, let's go in
Aiyyo clickety clank, that "Piggy Bank" shit is garbage
I thought it'd be harder than that
I thought G-Unit niggas worked harder than that
I mean most of the shit, that I'm hearin is wack
Young Buck hang on lah, I like the dude
But it's war and any day I'll eat your food
Lloyd Banks took Fab whole style, like you ain't know
All you missin is his chipped tooth smile
And homey I ain't never gon' respond to you
I don't care what you say or what the fuck you do
You don't deserve no raps 
Take your old ass home and take a nap, you garbage nigga
Ha ha, y'all not scary, don't the artists come from Yonkers
I know you wasn't talkin 'bout Mary 
You diesel fags, stay in the car
And go G-G-G-G, all day in your sports bra
I'm in the hood dick
'Member the place you used to come to, when your shit went brick
 Before Eminem ever heard the shit you kick
When you could walk around without none of your clique
I don't care about your money dawg, no hatin either
We can do this all day and I don't need a breather
I want you to shut us down, how that sound?
My name too strong you clown
Guaranteed it's the can of worms
You might wan' put the top back on, 'fore your ass get germs
Back then niggas wanted us to air y'all out
I said nah I kinda like what them niggas about
Before I knew about the rattin
Before you locked up half of Manhattan, Irv and his boys
Before you ran around in them bulletproof toys
I thought you was a "Problem Child"
I see niggas turn bitch when the shit get wild, ha ha
Yo ten mill' nigga, or twenty mill' sold 
You 'bout to lose the niggas that's gold
I explode on homey
I like bein out but I unload on homey, let's keep this peace dawg
Cause you and me both got them big ol' heats dawg
Hahahaha
That's how you rap right?
Fuck outta here nigga
Your shit garbage B
You don't sound Southern motherfucker
That fake-ass laugh and shit
You do that laugh so niggas don't see you cryin nigga
