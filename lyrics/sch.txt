Rock it, blast-blast, new beginnings
Lovely, pinky how not I remember, fiendin'

Freak the freckles off your face
Frenchy, freakin', swappin' tongue
Click my link and spread your buns
Lose your denim, make it numb
Blow it, baby, no Saddam
Fuckin' in the car service, thank me for the car pool
Chromosome, part full,
probly off a Norco
And gas, not the Arco, poppin' since the intro
You shoppin' from the window,

Let's get it – nights like this, I'm a knight like this
Sword in my hand, I fight like this

Bitch, touché, en garde
Toupée drop and her two tits pop
Out of that tank top and bra
And when I say "Doo-doo, doo-doo,"

She want some more of this
I give her more of this, I owe her this
In fact, I know she miss the way I floored this, on forgis
I know my Houston partners, drop a four on this
And focus, and slow it down
Alright, let me blow this bitch
I'm famous, I blame this on you, cash in the mirror
Hang in my penthouse roof, skyline the clearest
Watch it, your optics poppin' out, you look the weirdest
Pop my top on the 105, head with no power steerin', ah!

Bitch, gimme the discWhat is life for a nigga like me?
Living out his backpack every night
Needed a new place to sleep
But this is now, nigga
One's for the money, two for the bitches
Three to get ready cause I feel I finally did it
Four's for the jealous rapper mad because he finished
Turn that mothafucka to a critic
Man, I got so much shit up on my plate, dog
I was hanging on them corners late
Pockets wasn't straight, bitch
I ain't gon' make it at this rate, dog, know what I'm saying?
Nigga praying up to God just hoping that he hear a nigga
I know the world got more problems and it's much bigger
But I figured, I'd get some shit up off my chest
To all my niggas I would die for, load my pistol up, go out and war for
To all my niggas that'll never make it out the streets
Fuck it, keep goin' hard, don't let 'em see you weak
To all my niggas first time stepping in the pen
Read a book and exercise, keep your spirit in
To all my niggas that's gon' fuck around and die today
Take our hats off, bow our heads and let us pray, just wanna say
Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Don't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga
Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Don't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga, ah
Now how the fuck I'm 'posed to say this?
You see my nigga just lost his son
While I'm here hugging on my daughter, I grip her harder
Kiss her on the head as I cry for a bit
Thinking of some bullshit to tell him
Like "It'll be okay, you'll be straight, it'll be aight"
Well, fuck that shit
Whatever you need, yo, I got it!
Whether it's money or some weed or putting in work
Fuck it, then I'm riding
You know what's up, but now a nigga couldn't stick around
Told myself that after y'all moved
That I'd be a fuckin' fool, to be living by the street rules
"Fuck police" tattoos, that happens when you ditch school
But anyway, keep the faith
Stay strong, bruh, remain solid, bruh
Keep playing ball, cuz
It's the only way up out it, bruh,
a nigga proud of ya
Tell Floyd to enjoy his newborn seed
I'll have whatever he needs,
we the last of a dying breed
Live life, smoke trees
See how far we've come but most, I'm sorry for your son
Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Don't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga
Stay blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Don't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga, ah
And you ain't gotta shed no tear
I'll be everywhere but I'ma always be right here
I ain't forgot those years
I'll be everywhere but I'ma always be right here
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar &
ScHoolboy Q
]
Living in a premature place, wait
Never grow to see the pearly gates,
break
Every time a bullet detonate, dates
Of obituary carry crates
Of a scary picture with a family member that relate to ya
In December you was finna pin another case
On your record in a stolen Expedition, play it safe
As the record spinning, you was hearing angels entertain
Every pun intended, that was wicked, coming from your brain
Recognize you listened and you didn't hit the block again
That's because the minute after you had knew you would be slain
Open up another chapter in the book and read 'gain
Story of a gun-clapper really tryna make a change
Everybody ain't
blessed, my nigga
Yes, my nigga, you're blessed, take advantage, do your best, my nigga
Don't stress,
you was granted everything inside this planet
Anything you imagine, you possess, my nigga
You reject these niggas that neglect your respect
For the progress of a baby step, my nigga
Step-step my nigga, one, two, skip-skip
Back-back, look both ways, pull it off the hip
Blast at anybody say that you can't flip
This crack into rap music every other zip is a track
Get used to it, get it off quick
Come back, give back to the city you've built
That's that, don't trip, see money, fuck niggas, dog
It ain't nothing but a bunch of fuck niggas, dog
In a minute everybody gon' be winning
Put a little faith in it then recognize that we all
Blessed my nigga, blessed my nigga
Really think about it, could be worse my nigga
Don't stress my nigga, yes, my nigga
We all blessed my nigga, ahTroy...
Listen
I gotta say what's on my mind
Somethin' about us doesn't seem right these days
Life keeps getting in the way
Whenever we try, somehow, the plan
Is always rearranged
It's so hard to say
But I gotta do what's best for me
You'll be okay
I've got to move on and be who I am
I just don't belong here, I hope you understand
We might find a place in this world someday
But at least for now
I gotta go my own way
Don't wanna leave it all behind
But I get my hopes up and I watch them fall every time
Another color turns to gray
And it's just too hard to watch it all
Slowly fade away
I'm leavin' today
'Cause I gotta do what's best for me
You'll be okay
I've got to move on and be who I am
I just don't belong here, I hope you understand
We might find our place in this world someday
But at least for now
I gotta go my own way
What about us?
What about everythin' we've been through?
What about trust?
You know I never wanted to hurt you
What about me?
What am I supposed to do?
[GABRIELLA

I gotta leave but
I'll miss you
Oh
So, I've got to move on and be who I am
Why do you have to go?

I'm trying to understand
We might find a place in this world someday
But at least for now
I want you to stay
I gotta go my own way
I've got to move on and be who I am
What about us?
I just don't belong here, I hope you understand
I'm trying to understand
We might find our place in this world someday

Reminding me of the block I repped
The turf I stepped, the church and the earth I blessed
The first I guessed the alert was the murk I chef
That hearse the flirt with perks of a kill confessed
Dispersed the worst, the first 48 addressed
The search of laws and verse of the birth I nest

Évidemment qu'j'suis joueur
J'ai plus peur d'échouer
Noyé dans des larmes de douleur
Tes diamants, sèche-les
Quand elle brille tout là-haut
Elle nous voit j'réalise à quel point l'ciel est beau
J'ai les mains sur une crosse, le teflon sur le dos
Dans l'vent et la braise on a grandi
Mais j'veux mourir près de l'eau
Hein, faut qu'j'la sorte du coma, avec ou sans love
Stoppés par l'temps, l'égo, l'amour du mauve
J'cause au mur j'entends dans ses murmures qu'j'ai mis son cœur en lambeaux
Hier encore t'avais mon nom sur les lèvres
Depuis l'aube t'es plus la même
Où qu'on aille tu m'as dit aimer c'est pas le tout
Rien n'est à moi, rien n'est à nous
Ma santé pour un SMIC, j'préfère crever riche et solo
Teille j'zone ivre,
crosse celui qui s'met devant
Ma vie dans un disque, mon son dans ton bando
À nos morts, à nos restes en photo
Te-tê haute, nés pour mourir debout
On affrontera quand même
J'ai oublié comment vivre
Tant qu'le soleil s'lève avec ou sans love
Tant qu'mère n'est pas sauve
J'suis parti j'ai pris des risques
Mais j'vais pas revenir pauvre
J'te l'ai dit j'tiendrai promesse
Tu m'as pas vu changer l'fusil d'épaule
J'ai du temps j'ai peu sommeil
Ma gorge nouée, mes peines en chiffre
Si tu m'entends j'suis entier
J't'ai dit chérie attends moi j'suis en guerre
Tu m'attends, tu m'perds
D'puis longtemps j'le savais j'ai vu clair
Laisse tomber j'ai plus mal
J'parle à la Lune j'vois ton reflet dans l'eau
Tu m'as pas vu changer l'fusil d'épaule
Tu m'as pas vu changer l'fusil d'épaule
Tu m'as pas vu changer l'fusil d'épaule
Tu m'as pas vu changer l'fusil d'épaule
Quand les regrets reviennent
J'repense et j'tourne en rond
Jamais plus je n'te dirai bébé reviens
Tant pis pour le reste j'ai pas r'tourné ma veste
Tu t'es sentie seule dedans
Quand le temps passe les plaies s'estompent
On oublie pas on vit avec
À nos morts, à vous
Gouache sur les phalanges : violent
J'ai grandi j'ai plus les mêmes hantises qu'avant
J'ai choisi de le faire à leur détriment
Tu m'as pas vu changer l'fusil d'épaule
Tu m'as pas vu changer l'fusil d'épaule
Tu m'as pas vu changer l'fusil d'épaule
Tu m'as pas vu changer l'fusil d'épaule
J'affronterai quand même
Tant qu'le soleil s'lève
Avec ou sans love
Tant qu'mère n'est pas sauve
J'suis parti j'ai pris des risques
Mais j'vais pas revenir pauvre
J'te l'ai dit j'tiendrai promesse

Scélérat Fuck rap, I've been rich, crack by my stick shift
Oxy like concerts, always my bread first
"Get Mine" my nickname, O-X and cocaine
Nina my new thing, blew up before fame
Heart filled with octane, fire in my soul
Burn through my shoestring, came up from boosting
Du-rags and flatlines,
drive-bys at bedtime
Get down, I heard mom, someone lost they grandson
Thank God that I'm straight, no wonder my mom prayed
Lost one of my cuzzos, cursed from them devils
Good weed and me time, goodbye to Nissan
Cause one day this rappin' gon' pay

Now we 'bout to break the bank
My time to show out,
finally the illest Crip
And I guarantee, I spit harder than concrete
Surprised I got teeth,
my lungs inhale keef
Peyote with THC, swinging for the fence
I hope I make it out the park, where the baseheads slide
After dark, where the bangers get caught
Hid the gun in the trees, arrest me by the court
I just wanna smoke weed and sip lean by the quart, for real
Good weed, I hit that, crack rock, I sold that
Oxy, I hid that, right by my nutsack
Fuck pigs, I bust back, learned that from Deuce rat
Peanut and B-loon, had gats before racks
Way 'fore I found rap, bitch, I had them things wrapped
Astro on my cap,
this shot ain't no phone app
Chucks on my young heel, make sure that my sag ill
Learn my set trip grill, trade in my big wheel
Good grades and skipped school,
this life gon' catch up soon
Sure 'nough that shit did, twenty-year-old kid
Got off my behind, write me some sweet lines
Cause one day my story gon' pay
So now we 'bout to break the bank
Money be on my mind

Neck full of gold, I'm attracted to the honey
Rain, sleet, snow, 'bout the money
On Figueroa, close your eyes, might need ya mommy
Fuck rap, my shit real, came up off them pills
Hustle for my meal, grindin' for my deal
Love how I'm doin', long way from grooving
Bitch call me 2 Chainz, units be moving
Go hard for my Joy, so she don't need no boy
Smile stay on her face, big room with her own space
Up all night, the hard way, don't care if it take all day
I let y'all fucks parler, you wonder why I'm straight
New shoes and sick clothes, bitches be front row
Bow down her temple, I don't know her info
Threw up my peace sign,

Je serai pas trop là mais tu sais, j't'aime bébé
On a grandi mal, c’est la faute à la télé
J’pourrai pas tout te dire c’est sûr, tu te feras des films
Tu m’imagineras nu dans un lit
Dans les cuisses d’une autre fille
Moi, j’serai partout donc tu m’attendras du rimmel sous les cils
Ma photo portrait dans des cadres
La solitude te fera des signes
J’reviendrai, tu seras distante mais j'sais toujours te faire rire
J’saurai toujours te faire crier, j'saurai toujours te faire pire
Non, j'aurais pas tout fait pour te perdre mais j't'ai perdu
Heureusement qu'j'ai pas tout fait pour te plaire
C'est hyper dur mais au fond j'sais que tu vas partir
M'laisser seul dans un cinq étoiles
Encore une fois j'me dirai qu'je n'ai que ma mère
Allô Maman ? 
Ça va pas fort j'ai peur du temps
Allô Maman ? 
J'aime pas tes rides et tes cheveux blancs
Allô Maman ? 
Bobo, bobo
Allons-nous-en
Allô Maman ? 
Ça va pas fort j'ai peur du temps
Allô Maman ? 
J'aime pas tes rides et tes cheveux blancs
Allô Maman ? 
J'crois qu't'as b'soin d'repos
Allons-nous-en
J'serai ni trop lâche, ni mort pour ma franchise
Vieux avant l'âge, j'reçois que des éloges
Mais je dois t'affranchir,
j'parle à la faucheuse
La nuit j'me réveille en nage sûrement noyé par mes torts
Noyé par mes remords, ou l'argent que j'ai à blanchir
Là je suis partout,
toi tu m'inspires mais t'es plus là
Bébé toutes les tess' de France me disent que je suis un artiste
Peut-être qu'il fallait que j'te retienne
Qu'il fallait que je te prenne, qu'il fallait qu'on s'tire
Mais maman devait vivre mieux, maman mérite un empire
J'aurai pas tout fait pour m'y perdre, j'm'y suis perdu
Heureusement qu'j'ai pas tout fait pour m'y plaire
C'est hyper dur, mais au fond j'devais partir
T'laisser seule compter les étoiles
Encore une fois je m'en vais faire de l'oseille
Allô Maman ? 
Ça va pas fort j'ai peur du temps
Allô Maman ? 
J'aime pas tes rides et tes cheveux blancs
Allô Maman ? 
J'crois qu't'as b'soin d'repos
Allons-nous-en
J'aurais pas tout fait pour te perdre mais j't'ai perdu
Heureusement qu'j'ai pas tout fait pour te plaire
C'est hyper dur mais au fond tu vas partir
M'laisser seul dans un cinq étoiles
Encore une fois j'me dirai qu'je n'ai que ma mère
Allô Maman
, ça va pas fort j'ai peur du temps
Allô Maman
, j'aime pas tes rides et tes cheveux blancs
Allô Maman, bobo bobo
Allons-nous-en
Allô Maman ? 
Ça va pas fort j'ai peur du temps
Allô Maman ? 
J'aime pas tes rides et tes cheveux blancs
Allô Maman ? 
J'crois qu't'as b'soin d'repos
Allons-nous-en
Ouais m'man ça va ? J'te rappelle après, j'ai plein de travail...
Pardon...This the shit that they need
Tell me where are you from
Drop your pants to your knees
Girl, I'm capital G
Might pull up in my bucket
This nine holds a good dozen
Might slide up in your cousin
Just made a mil' and still thuggin'
Niggas banged on me but they should've shot me
See, I hit the corner then spot him, got him
Court date, but I skipped the bail
Rather wig myself before I sit in jail
Need a gang of weed and a pint of lean
Got a hat say Figg' on my gangsta tip
Don't trust no ho, I might sock the bitch
I'm apocalypse to your politics
Might cop the Phantom, get ghost
I can pay your bills with this coat
Need an extra band for this smoke
I can see for miles with this scope, nigga
Got an oxy-scribed to this dope dealer
Misses Piggy, want a piggyback
Rock cremation, then called it crack
I'mma keep on eating 'til my ankles fat
Sell that fix, throw it cross the map
Push my penis in between her lap
Put my semen all down her throat
'Til Tito kilos come off that boat
This the shit that they want
This the shit that they need
Tell me where are you from?
Drop your pants to your knees
Girl, I'm capital G

This the shit they gon' bump
This the shit that they want
This the shit that they want
Yeah, this that four niggas in a Regal flow
Speeding through the yellow lights
Treat my Versace belt like it's a mistletoe
I put everything over yellow rice
Graduated from hella ice
If I stand on my bankroll 
Nigga, I'd be scared of heights
And I'd be dodging the po-lice
When I was poor with no lights
When I was poor with potential
Watch my flow in four inches
Oh Lord, she in Christians
All gold for my Adventist
Pulled it down and she kissed it
All gold where my wrists is
God'll judge, no conviction
Just because I got dreads don't get it twisted
Moving my whip down the boulevard
Word 'round town, I was selling hard
Hard and I'm talking bout the yayo
Hit her on the floor and then I lay low
Amigos say "Que pasa with the pesos?"
Promethazine codeine, caseloads
And when I pull up to the valet
You know I got the strippers on payroll!
This the shit that they want
This the shit that they need
Tell me where are you from?
Drop your pants to your knees
Girl, I'm capital G
This the shit they gon' buy
This the shit why I'm fly

This the shit they gon' bump
This the shit that they want
This the shit that they want
100k in my trunk
Keep that bitch with that donk
She gon' pop in them heels
She must heard of my deal
She gon' roll on them pills
Just don't grab on my hat
This that shit that's Iraq
This that make you climax
This that shit you just bought
This that Q go hamhawk
This that car that won't park
Pedal to floor, it won't stop
And just when you thought it won't drop
Oxymoron in stores
Come in, kids, lock the door
Knock-knock-knock, hit the floor
Need my bread off the top
Could buy anything off the lot
This that steel, not the grill
Get them slugs off for real
This that curl with the gel
We gon' win, smoke the L's
She love my mic, rock the bell
Leave that punani killed
All them hoes run to Q
Spit that truth,
make the loot
Expensive whips, we hotbox
Spent 2 bills on my socks
This that make you cockblock
This that make me pop shot
This that filthy convo
This that must be Figueroa
This the shit that they want
This the shit that they need
Tell me where are you from?
Drop your pants to your knees

Des tueurs qu'tu trouves adorables, oh

Fils de pute, on tire, on va pas rater,

Sur un banc, j'ai grandi, là j'vis Rue Paradis
J'passe le Prado piano dans mon quatre anneaux
Encore un son déclassé, j'en ai pour les putos
Y a des bitchs, on va cramer, j'suis qu'de passage
J'viens du trou du cul d'en bas moi, nous, on a ramé
Mon bras, mon Cobra, on compose un syndic'
Mon gang son aura,

Yeux tout black, j'reprends ton rrain-té comme l'Antéchrist
Là, c'est plus comme avant, j'sors en pare-balles
Fuck un assistant

T'as l'choix, jugé par douze ou porté par six
Client dans un trip, j'l'encaisse avant l'OD
On n'a plus d'âme et tu sais déjà qu'on est maudits

Mon pote on gravit, on s'arrose
Ici, tout pour la famille, Cosa Nostra
Cœur en glace, rappelle-toi l'incendie
Les gens qu'j'aime, table à mille eu, j'sais qu'ils m'envient eux
Le sun s'est levé, je n'dormais pas
Ces pierres précieuses en témoignent
Le ciel s'éclaire avec ou sans toi
J'la quitterai si mère veut qu'j'm'en sépare
Même si on arrête là, ça n'arrête pas
On kiffe et on n'arrête pas
Une seule vie donc le temps presse
Le temps presse et le ciel nous fait des dessins
J'tourne en ville phares éteints,
les films ont déteint
Nous, on prend la haine, on t'éteint
Le sun s'est levé, je n'dormais pas,
hier est un acquis
Personne ne m'a promis demain
Et t'faire mourir, j'ai 10 000 façons, là, c'est la moisson
On va t'ligoter comme un saucisson
J'oublierai pas mes racines sous prométhazine
Éteins tes putains d'phares au hazi, là, t'es pas à Aldi
Ma mère vise aussi bien au .38 qu'elle écrit au Bic
Mes kheys, ils ont des r'gards innocents
, ils ouvrent des coffres au plastic
J'ai digéré les plus jolies putes, ça m'fout plus la trique
Avant d'voir d'Saint-Nicolas, j'me ferais bien un flic
Perso, nous on est armés, jeunes et hargneux
J'vole au-d'ssus d'un nid d'oiseaux, j'sais pas lequel épargner
Hier R, aujourd'hui entreprise, tiens mon KBIS
On sort ni vendredi ni samedi, j'suis mieux d'vant l'alim'
Tu m'verras plus qu'en stard-co et en poster
J'suis pas dans leurs délires de All-Star, j'suis moi et ma paire
Température Häagen-Dazs, gris comme à Stuttgart
Mon shlass dans son fourreau comme Zelda
,
génération Shootstar
Fils de pute, on a grandi
Donc ton trou d'balle s'agrandit
J'ai perdu des potos, j'ai même plus les photos
Mon daron s'appelait Otto, il aimait pas les putos
Le sun s'est levé, je n'dormais pas
Ces pierres précieuses en témoignent
Le ciel s'éclaire avec ou sans toi
J'la quitterai si mère veut qu'j'm'en sépare
Même si on arrête là, ça n'arrête pas
On kiffe et on n'arrête pas
Une seule vie donc le temps presse
Le temps presse et le ciel nous fait des dessins
J'tourne en ville phares éteints,
les films ont déteint
Nous, on prend la haine, on t'éteint
Le sun s'est levé, je n'dormais pas, hier est un acquis
Personne ne m'a promis demain
J'connais des tueurs qu'tu trouves adorables
Un ennemi mort, c'est la tranquillité
Un gosse, une crosse qui dépasse de l'anorak
Apprends qu'le respect passe par l'humilité
Des tueurs qu'tu trouves adorables, oh
Le respect

And became a fucking G, moved my crack across the street

Didn't know what he was saying 'til them years done jumped to three
Learned the game, slanging hoes and every car door need a key

Qu'est-ce qu'on aurait pas donné ?
Pour le gang, pour son respect
Lequel on aurait pardonné ?
J'ferai le pire pour bâtir un empire
Suis les ordres, le cadavre est lesté
J'respire, j'le mets dans ma tire et j'expire
J'repense aux fois où j'aurais pu y rester
Trempé dans l'sale, t'as des faiblesses
Faut qu'personne les ressente
Au fond d'la succursale, assiégés à une table
Dressons l'état des ventes
Grandi dans le sang, on devient dit-ban sans le vouloir
On va mourir ensemble
Armes brandies, dans le centre, de formes différentes
Mais tu sais au fond on se ressemble
On va pas s'replier
On s’entre-tuera jusqu'au dernier Homme
Jusqu'au dernier denier
Vie dure et luxure, tir à bout portant j'éclabousse le damier
Poto, j'suis debout d'puis l'aube
Sur l'deux roues j'pilote
Le bruit du Beretta précède l'épilogue
Bang bang, bang bang, bang bang
Le bruit du Beretta précède l'épilogue
Bang bang, bang bang, bang bang
Y'aura du sang sur les métaux, ça sera la fin d'l'épisode
Bang bang
Tu craindras les tes-tê casquées
T'entends qu'on est des frayeurs
J'crève en QHS, en HP
Crève dans mes locaux, mauvais payeur
Surveille ton langage, ne m'parle pas comme si j'tais né hier
Lequel, dans l'crime, est l'meilleur ?
J'viendrai t'arroser dans ton bar
J'laisse une grenade au comptoir, du sang plein les théières
On a troué les décors d'la ville,
estimé le prix d'leur vie
Démarré des stories dans l'vif du sujet, elles ont fini rouge vif
Mourir jeune comme Daniele
Regarde c'qu'on a fait pour l'chiffre
Prendre la vie, la violer
Souffrir, shooter les sous-fifres
On va pas s'replier
On s'entretuera pour l'honneur des nôtres
La mémoire d'nos oubliés
Vie dure et luxure,
courir après l'temps, rêver d'figer l'sablier
Poto, j'suis debout d'puis l'aube
Sur l'deux roues j'pilote
Le bruit du Beretta précède l'épilogue

J'suis attendu chez toi comme Don PietroI really need you
I really need your love right now
I'm fading fast
Not gonna last
I'm really stupid
I'm burning up, I'm going down
I'm in it bad
Don't even ask
When I found myself in the middle, in the middle, in the middle
Could you love me more, just a little, just a little
Overcomplicate when it's simple, when it's simple, when it's simple
Would you love me more, just a little
So tell me now
When every star falls from the sky
And every last heart in the world breaks
Oh hold me now
When every ship is going down
I don't fear nothing when I hear you say
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay
It's gonna be okay
I'm really sorry
Sorry I dragged you into this
I overthink, that's all it is
The way you love me
The way you love me 'til the end
The way you love me
Oh yeah, it makes me king again
When I found myself in the middle, in the middle, in the middle
Could you love me more, just a little, just a little
Overcomplicate when it's simple, when it's simple, when it's simple
Would you love me more, just a little
So tell me now
When every star falls from the sky
And every last heart in the world breaks
Oh hold me now
When every ship is going down
I don't fear nothing when I hear you say
It's gonna be okay

J’passe sur S.K.Y, j’passe sur OKLM
Ça sent l'Gris Montaigne,
pute les grosses fiscalités
J’passe te tuer ce weekend, après j’baiserai ta mère
J’lui chanterai “Si Tu Savais” comme Jean-Philippe Smet
Cristaline pleine de Ciroc
Les jeunes prennent la coke et visent la te-tê
Mon pays c'est plaqué 1-3, mets-toi un doigt
Tête brûlée, BCBG, avec des PGP
bossent H24 en TP, entêtés
On revient pas au début
Y’a des mères qui pleurent leurs fils, hier c’étaient encore leurs bébés
Rien qu’on pense au débit
Demande à Laps' un .45 et j’rép' au rébus
J’pisse sur l’industrie ouais qui l’aurait cru ?
Puto, pourtant j’l’avais dit
Moi j’vais p’t-être mourir du plomb
Deux-trois connards diront qu’j’étais bon
Toi t’applaudis Gédéon pédéraste, tu sais qu’le te-traî lui connaît Léon
Dans la jungle un putain d’bleu c’est l’caméléon
J’compte plus les déceptions, les gens qu’j’ai à dos
J’étais tit-pe, j’voyais l’te-shi calmer les grands
Y’a des crimes en bas Maman, tire tes rideaux
Plantes en floraison sous les néons
Cocaïne noyée dans l'bain-marie
Meurs à tous petits feux sous les rayons
Du soleil qui brûle le goudron d’ma ville
J’mets l’plein, rien à foutre du prix du baril
J’attends ta te-tê pour payer la prime
J’attends d’voir naître ma concu’, j’attends ton cul
J’attends qu’la pute de Juge libère Karim
J’crois beaucoup en l’chiffre, peu en l’homme
Peu en l’homme, quitte à être détesté
Tu veux nous imiter, on a trop d’identité
Ils nous reconnaissent au blind test
J’roule en gros caisson j’monte le son
J’traîne au tiekson sans teflon
J’arrive en moto tu prends tout sur l’flanc gauche
On reculera pas, tu peux nous sortir des noms
Nous, on connaît ni un tel ni un tel
À c’qu’il paraît qu’ils font trembler la ville
J’dis qu’un gosse avec un AK-47
C’est plus dangereux qu’le feu d’la pègre en Italie
Tain-p', j’crois qu’on est d’accord
Tout l’projet a du corps
Vu l’espoir qu’j’y ai mis, vu les jeunes qu’on était
J’trouve ça bien qu’on s’en sorte
Fils de pute, tu peux gruger un temps mais pas toujours
Jamais trop tard pour ouvrir un livre
T’as fait ton disque d’or, tain-p'
Dans six mois il vaudra l’prix du cuivre
Les plus belles tain-p' dans les plus belles bres-cham
C’est la crise j’suis logé pute à deux pas des Champs
On dit qu’on va bien, tout est relatif
J’dis qu’j’suis quelqu’un d’bien, tout est relatif

J'étais R gros fils de pute, on court pour mourir libre
J'mattais que l'horloge, comme si j’allais mourir dans l’heure
J’vais pas leur mentir, j’suis très bien entouré
J’posais déjà sous un préau, j’voyais pas ça comme j'le vis
J’ai grandi, Papa m’a pas vu faire
Il est seul, j’y pense c’est vrai
Pour lui la vie : rien d’évident
J’crois qu’elle t’a jamais souri
Il m’faudrait des millions rien qu'pour rattraper l’temps gâché
Et qu'on m'crame dans l’centre-ville si un jour j’t’ai oublié
J’me torture l’esprit, faut qu’j’les sorte de la merde
Tant qu’j’ai la santé, fils de pute, tant qu’on a des idées

YeahYou can bet there's nothin' but net
When I am in a zone and on a roll
But I got a confession, my own secret obsession
And it's making me lose control
Everybody gather 'round
Well, if Troy can tell his secret, then I can tell mine
...I bake
What?
I love to bake! Strudels, scones, even apple pandowdy
Not another sound!
Someday, I hope to make the perfect crême brûlée!
No, no, no, no
No, no, no
Stick to the stuff you know
If you wanna be cool, follow one simple rule
Don't mess with the flow, no, no
Stick to the status quo
Look at me and what do you see?
Intelligence beyond compare
But, inside, I am stirring, something strange is occurring
It's a secret I need to share
Open up, dig way down deep
Hip hop is my passion! I love to pop and lock and jam and break
Is that even legal?
Not another peep!
It's just dancing! Sometimes, I think it's cooler than homework
No, no, no, no
No, no, no
Stick to the stuff you know
It is better by far to keep things as they are
Don't mess with the flow, no, no
Stick to the status quo
Listen well, I'm ready to tell
About a need that I cannot deny
Dude, there's no explanation for this awesome sensation
But I'm ready to let it fly
Speak your mind and you'll be heard
Alright, if Troy wants to be a singer, then I'm comin' clean
I play the cello!
Awesome! What is it?
...A saw?
No, dude, it's like a giant violin
Not another word!
Do you have to wear a costume?
Coat and tie
No, no, no, no

Don't mess with the flow, no, no
Stick to the status quo
This is not what I want
This is not what I planned
And I just gotta say
I do not understand
Something is really—
Something's not right!
Really wrong
And we gotta get things back where they belong
We can do it!
Gotta play!
Stick with what you know
We can do it!
Hip hop, hooray!
She has got to go
We can do it!
Crême brûlée!
Keep your voice down low
Not another peep, no
Not another word, no
Not another sound, no
Everybody, quiet!
Why is everybody staring at you?
Not me. You!
Because of the callbacks?
I can't have people staring at me, I really can't!
No!
No, no, no

If you wanna be cool, follow one simple rule
Don't mess with the flow, no, no

Ils m'verront plus qu'en 1080p
J'ai 1000 cartes en main
J'suis sur tous les rrains-té
Tous les rrains-té, tous les bétons
On a grandi te-tê dans l'étau
Poto, tu sais qu'on vient racheter ta ville
Nouveaux riches avec des métaux
Tonton, j'suis au carré, j'paie pas l'entrée
On a vidé les 'teilles nos regards sont hantés
Toi, j'te baise tant qu'j'ai la santé
Toi et ta putain d'équipe les garçons manqués
Boite sept, ma te-tê s'colle à l'appuie-tête
J'bois sec, j'tiens le gobelet, le volant
C'est tous les jours le Nouvel An
Salope, on a connu la disette
Ils étaient pas là quand on était rien
J'espère bien qu'tu leur as dit
J'suis pas ton tit-pe
Garde-toi ta première partie, coño
Dans l'appart' ça pue la widow
Eux, ils verront mon doigt et mon dos
J'mange avec les politiques
C'est les nouveaux riches avec des teflons
J'les corrige juste avec un doigt
Au foyer, papa veut juste un toit
Tes potos s'achètent des habits
J'ai pas l'temps, faut que j'lui rachète un T3, mathafack
Du liquide, du liquide, du liquide, du liquide, du liquide
Mes chaussures brillent, j'regarde mes pieds
T'es dupliqué, dupliqué, dupliqué, dupliqué
Mon chichi dans la végétale, quand elle m'suce
Du liquide, du liquide, du liquide, du liquide, du liquide
Mes chaussures brillent...
T'es dupliqué, dupliqué, dupliqué, dupliqué
Mon chichi dans la végétale, quand elle m'suce
Si y'a deux trois putes, y'aura pas deux trois bouquets
Deux trois tours du globe en même pas deux trois week-ends
Je vous ai niqués, regarde mes freestyles
Dernière collection PP,
dernière Audemars-Piguet
Je fais du bif, on a la rue derrière
Du liquide, du liquide, si j'te fume on est quittes, en équipe
Tu connais pas ma vie, mon équipe
Des appart', des villas, des plaques diplomatiques
Des semi-automatique, des putes en talon
Te niquer ta mère, fiston, c'est la thématique
Si je te fume
Ça fait un de moins pas besoin de mathématiques
Tu peux pas nous suivre
Même mon fils ne met plus du plaqué Gabbana
J'suis sorti d'la misère
Il aura son hôtel à Copacabana
On part à Dubaï
En un soir j'ai niqué tous mes sous
J'rentre à l'hôtel
Un jaccuzzi, ma chérie me masse le cou
Envoie la monnaie
Les belles choses ont un coût
Prends pas tout mon temps
J'ai des rendez-vous
J'ai bien mangé
Je sors de table et la bouffe m'a coûté ton salaire
J'te baise ta mère
Mes petits peuvent fumer Le Banner
Grosso modo, j'en ai gros sur le dos
Casque intégral, une grosse moto
Ils aiment trop parler de la guerre mais ces sales fils de putain n'auront fait que celle des boutons
Du liquide, du liquide, du liquide, du liquide, du liquide
Mes chaussures brillent, j'regarde mes pieds
T'es dupliqué, dupliqué, dupliqué, dupliqué
Mon chichi dans la végétale, quand elle m'suce
Du liquide, du liquide, du liquide, du liquide, du liquide
Mes chaussures brillent...
T'es dupliqué, dupliqué, dupliqué, dupliqué
Mon chichi dans la végétale, quand elle m'suce
45 gros moteur
Les tits-pe voudront te faire
Ils vont remonter ton salaire
Nous on va remonter l'employeur
On connait pas nos peurs
On connait peu nos pères
Tout ton hall sent la paraffine
Tu vas pas nous faire, on sait d'où vient l'odeur

Part 1: "Prescription"
]
Prescription drugs, show me love
Percocets,
Adderall
Xanny bars,
get codeine involved
Stuck in this body high, can't shake it off
I'm falling off, I can't hold a thought
What's wrong with me? Now depression creep
I'm stressing deep, even in my sleep
My mommy call, I hit ignore
My daughter calls, I press ignore
My chin press on my chest, my knees press the floor
I'm blanking out, woke up on the couch
Dinner on my shirt, my stomach hurts
I had a ball sellin' 80s but yo, the karma's worse
I cry when nothing's wrong, I'm mad when peace is involved
My senses harmed, sluggish ruggish
A couple Xannies popped, open my pill box
Prescription drugs
Daddy, daddy
What's wrong, daddy?!
Wake up!
Wake up!
Prescription drugs, I fell in love
My little secret, she gon' kill a thug
My body numb, she like to give me hugs
I love her touch, I get a rush
When she don't come around, I start to go nuts
My heart erupts, I'm curled in pain
My phone ring, ring and ring and ring
If you ain't selling drugs, then I don't hear a thing
May 7, Ali calls, p.m. of 6:45, I finally answer this time
He said "Come to the stu', I'm mixing all your rhymes"
I don't decline, at least that's in my mind
Grab the keys, need some 'Woods for the trees
Dap the clerk 'fore I leave, max on my AC
Continue right, remember seeing light
Why it's night? But that's my life
Prescription drugs
What's wrong?
You tired?
You mad?
Okay, I love you, daddy

Part 2: "Oxymoron"
]
Uh, let me get some there for 20 dollars watch, 20 dollars
You can get one for 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, whatever, nigga
Seattle, what' up? Bitch, you gon' love me forever!

Oxy, I don't know no Pablo or no papi
What you know about a pill, plus a 8-ball
You gotta re-up 50 times just to get a rack off, ungh
I can get a hundred of 'em, make over 3 G's
Only took two days, only re-up'd one time
Where the sun barely shine and it rain for about
Nine months out the year, man it's something right here
For Seattle nigga, cheers
When I look up at y'all city like lookin' in the mirror
Damn near had a career, just might shed a tear, ungh
Man, this shit right here for my niggas who ain't make it home
Sitting on a tear, got a dap to a nigga bright in here
Feeling life ain't fair
If I was in your shoes, I would've copped, don't care
Had a scene, had the medics like clear, ungh
Big body cold like a Polar Bear, ungh
I done sold more shit than hookers
Expensive tees, resemble a push up
Stopped selling crack, cause white don't fuck with niggas
Uh—vanity slave,
got whips and chains
Dirty money, clean money the same
Even if I got life I ain't saying a name
Just stopped sellin' crack today 
I just stopped sellin' crack today 
O-X-Y, I'm moron
O-X-Y, I'm moron 
Just stopped sellin' crack today

O-X-Y, I'm moron
Groovy, when I die tell Spike Lee make a movie
Ooh wee, cops bringing dogs
Hope they don’t sniff my bitch booty
Oxy, O-X-Y, only feel like I could stop me
Quincy, now how you nigga sliding up
Every now and then in a Bentley?
Easy, 60-40-50
You can get one for 30 if you let me hold your titty
Let a nigga fuck then my dogs see your kitty
Just stopped selling crack today
When it get hot, smoke a pill, watch it
glide like Dr. J
I prescribe you, I'm your doctor, kay?
You can crush this shit, you can sniff this shit
You can take this shit, you can smoke this shit
Do you like this shit, nigga?
Your brain go numb, synthetic heroin
Without the injections, do the same love and affection
How could they say feeling good is an addiction?
But the world is full of shit, so I don't listen
In fact "We living to die" is a contradiction
So trapping in a Nissan, O-X-Y, I keep 'em, O-X-Y, you need one
Just stopped sellin' crack today 
I just stopped sellin' crack today 
O-X-Y, I'm moron
O-X-Y, I'm moron 
Just stopped sellin' crack today 
I just stopped sellin' crack today 
O-X-Y, I'm moron
O-X-Y, I'm moronIf you're evil and you're on the rise
You can count on the four of us taking you down
Cause we're good and evil never beats us
We'll win the fight and then go out for pizzas
We are the Crystal Gems
We’ll always save the day!
And if you think we can’t
We’ll always find a way!
That’s why the people of this world believe in
Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl and Steven!
If you could only know, what we really are
When we arrived on Earth, from out beyond your star
We were amazed to find, your beauty and your worth
And we will protect your kind, and we will protect your Earth
And we will protect your Earth
And we will protect you!
I will fight for the place where I’m free
To live together and exist as we
I will fight in the name of Rose Quartz!
And everything that she believed in
I will fight for the world I was made in
The Earth is everything I’ve ever known!
I will fight to be everything that everybody wants me to be when I’m grown
The odds are against us, it won’t be easy
But we’re not going to do it alone
We are the Crystal Gems
We’ll always save the day!
And if you think we can’t
We’ll always find a way!
That’s why the people of this world believe in
Garnet, Amethyst, and Pearl and Steven!
