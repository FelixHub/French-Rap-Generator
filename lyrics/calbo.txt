If you with the squad, I give you my heart, lil' nigga, I mean it 
I was fighting some demons, in the field, bitch, I'm deep in 
I was raised in the deep end , I know niggas be sinkin' 
Take your bitch and go deep in, but I gave her back, why you tweakin'? 
Come around with that rah-rah, we leave you dead on the cement 
With the gang, we ain't playing fair
Matter fact, we don't play at all
OG 'Woods in the air
But we bought the Runtz so we smoke it all
Putting on a front, boy, you better fall
We gon' kill 'em dead, we gon' kill 'em all
Might spend a ten when I'm in the mall
I was on the bend with it in my drawers
Hit that smoke and I'm blackin' 
Hit that smoke and I black out
If he run, blow his back down

Fresh out the trap and they know how I carry it
I fell in love with the game and I married it
200 thou' for the walk on a Saturday
I threw the wrap on the Phantom, it's matte today
Pushin' that bitch through the 'jects like a chariot
Diamonds on diamonds, they comin' in various
I gave that bitch $20,000 for charity
Counted me out and I'm back, and I'm havin' it, ayy
I'm from the trenches where I had to get it
I'm so used to trappin', I get it and flip it
I know that you be actin', I know you ain't with it
Bro, throw me the package, I wrap it and flip it
They say I got money so I'm actin' different
Get it by my lonely, so I never listen
Stay callin' my phone, this lil' bitch, she trippin'
Just leave me alone, I'm handlin' business
Work hard, I gotta get it 
Trap hard, we in the kitchen
Diamonds so cold, light even bend
And my niggas don't fold, they never bendin'
Took a loss, but shit happens, I get it
With the bosses, I'm payin' attention
Told that bitch I ain't wastin' no time
So, no, I can't wait, not a minute
And I pray to the Lord for better days
I'm flexin' hard like a heavyweight
Spent some racks and I bust down the bezel face
Got this .30 on me, make 'em run away, yeah
Bitch, I'm gettin' paid
I was in the trap whippin' shit like a slave
Can't put trust in these bitches, these bitches changed
On the block with them niggas, was goin' insane, yeah

No time to waste
Gotta get to this money, I'm runnin' late, yeah

My diamonds all colors like a gay parade 
Go on your bitch, I could've just laid
But I alley-oop'd to my homie, he ate 
I cooked that fishscale, he slimed out the plate
Got 52 watches and I still come in late
You a sassy bitch, but I don't go on dates
Diamonds canary, stone lemon cakes
Show me attention when I'm in your city
I'm so used to fuckin' on all of your bitches
They wanna fuck us and they know that we pimpin'
Giuseppe Zanotti, I cop by the 50, yeah

I kill in the streets, you tellin' 
Don't run, don't run
Make it home to my son 
I be with killers who kill other killers
I'm hangin' with Von
You'd rather buy the bitches back
I'd rather give a new house to my mom
Some niggas rather pray to the Bible
When I converted, I pray with my palms
See, keepin' my Glock when I'm in the field 
Hop in the Track and I burn out the wheels 
I fuck with the gangsters, don't fuck with my peers
Fresh out of Jeffrey's, I hop on the Lear
Grippin' that .40, not talkin' a beer
Flawless the diamonds, I boog out the ear
Bentley do wheelies, I pop it in gear
Eight in my cup when I'm walkin' through, clear
Mm-mm-mm-mm, this lifestyle
Man, that X is fuckin' my pupil
Just turn these lights down
I'm just a wild, wild boy
Chopper ridin' 'round for him

Even though I be workin', baby, I can't see you often
And she gorgeous, drop dead, she fresh out the coffin
Play with her, you drop dead, we don't do no talkin'
Boy, this shit ain't easy
Swear that bitch my Eve, I might take that bitch to Eden
None of that shit make believe, I knew that bitch was a demon
Told her don't break my heart, then I watched that lil' bitch eat it
She change like the seasons, why you get so greedy?
Alright, let me tell you how it started
I was with my niggas, we was trappin' out apartments
Unc' was my big homie, he say that love shit is nonsense
We come from the trenches, baby, we was taught to pop shit
Ayy, but I wasn't tryna listen, baby, I was feelin' dark
Told the bitch come and link up when I'm trappin' out the park
Ayy, and she made me feel better, so I gave that bitch my heart
I was thinkin' from the heart, introduce her to the mob
Ayy, meanwhile, foenem tryna clown
I said, "Boy, don't doubt, I rock with her proud"
I might say that loud
That clear, she got to switchin', I gave it a year
Them bitches, they wanted me all in they ear
Now look at a nigga, I'm man of the year
Darling, you know you my darling
Even though I be workin', baby, I can't see you often
And she gorgeous, drop dead, she fresh out the coffin
Play with her, you drop dead, we don't do no talkin'
Boy, this shit ain't easy
Swear that bitch my Eve, I might take that bitch to Eden
None of that shit make believe, I knew that bitch was a demon
Told her don't break my heart, then I watched that lil' bitch eat it
She change like the seasons, why you get so greedy?
Got me feelin' a lil' darker
I can't trust these niggas, they like sharks up in this water
Had that lil' bitch cross me like Samson and Delilah
So I'm still ridin' solo, bitch, I don't got a partner
You know how I'm vibin', I'm ridin'
Bend a couple blocks and I got my lil' brother drivin'
Devil on my shoulder, I can't wait 'til we come find him
She gone like the serpent, I swear that lil' bitch so slimy
I got demons in my face, but the angels right behind me
I ain't never lose my faith, my soul gold and that's timeless
I done found a few ways to get paid, now I'm grindin'
And I love the role that you play, made me stay, I was blinded, yeah
Darling, you know you my darling
Even though I be workin', baby, I can't see you often
And she gorgeous, drop dead, she fresh out the coffin
Play with her, you drop dead, we don't do no talkin'
Boy, this shit ain't easy
Swear that bitch my Eve, I might take that bitch to Eden
None of that shit make believe, I knew that bitch was a demon
Told her don't break my heart, then I watched that lil' bitch eat it
She change like the seasons, why you get so greedy?What up, Super?
Don't say you love me

What you need? I ain't trippin', bitch, I got it 
We might catch 'em slippin', then it's tragic 
Reach up to the stars, gotta have it

Stealin' out the store, sleepin' on my cousin floor 
Now I'm up, it feel like everybody give a fuck 
I was lookin' for some love, but I ain't get enough 
They don't wanna see me win , now they ask if I remember
Now you gotta meet me again , thought I'd never leave the country
All these felonies , scared to hit licks with niggas
'Cause they might bail on me , or worse, tell on me 
Man, this shit get ugly , I been through some shit
You might not wanna love me , outlaw, screamin' "Thug Life"
Only God can judge me, this for all the hoes that played around
When I was dusty , didn't wanna fuck me 
They judge me, but they don't know that I been broke

I'm from the trenches where it's you or me
But I show love to all my brothers like I'm Huey P
Ain't no guidance, OG ain't worried 'bout truancy
Shorty got caught up on that side, they beat him brutally
Traumatized, my whole city been through cruelty
Send them shots, somebody died, it happens usually
On the block, them guys don't tolerate no foolery
Watch my young nigga spend them racks on jewelry 
Young king, you just gotta stay focused
On the grind, gotta get it, ain't no feelin' hopeless
I done been through what you been through, why you mopin'?
Had to take that risk and put my wrist in motion
I was young and reckless, I know that I'm older
Stayed out late, so I came home with moms and Pepsi Cola
Stayed out late 'cause I was workin', whippin' up the cola
And I pray 'cause I got angels watchin' over shoulders
Baby, what's the hold up? I can't go for hold up
I can't trust too many bitches, they got plenty motives
You niggas was penny pinchin', they won't say they stole none'
I came from the city, ain't no pity, cross you over
Death before dishonor, that's just how I live
I don't mean no harm, but for my brothers, I'll kill
Got it from the bottom, grinded up for real
Remember we was starvin', grindin' for the meals
I'm from the trenches where it's you and me
But I show love to all my brothers like I'm
Huey P
Ain't no guidance, OG ain't worried 'bout truancy
Shorty got caught up on that side, they beat him brutally
Traumatized, my whole city been through cruelty
Send them shots, somebody died, it happens usually
On the block, them guys don't tolerate no foolery
Watch my young nigga spend them racks on jewelry 
See, my cousin, he got laced, he bought weed without the seal
And I'm steady losin' my mind, don't know if it's the demons or the pills
I was in the county jail when Sosa 'nem had signed a deal
I'ma self-defend myself like it was an accident I killed
See, my brother Will on trial, boy, niggas left him hangin'
They ain't even go to trial for him, his homie wrote a statement
If I ain't never signed to Def Jam, I told Gotti I'll sign to him
Shout out to the city, they gon' envy like I'm Calboy
I don't know what you heard 'bout me
Don't believe the media, nigga, you know you should be worried 'bout me
Police snatched me up, but they know they ain't get a word out me
Pillow talkin' to these hoes, why you ask a girl 'bout me? Mmh
Yeah, you got some nerves 'bout it
You comin' 'round to take some pics and get some syrup out me
Neighborhood hero
I done lost an oldhead who died over CeeLo
And my life a VEVO, yeah
[Chorus: Calboy &
Yo Gotti

The case still open, social media the laws 
I was re-in' up when these niggas was doin' fraud 
Niggas scammin', I was grammin', givin' packs to my dawgs 
Check my history, nigga, I don't do battle rappin' 
I'm like a hundred mil' up when I get tired of rappin' 
All time high, you should be tired of cappin'
When you put in some work, I don't wanna know what happened 
I'm really from the trenches, pull the Lam' in it 
Nigga, you ain't from that hood, you ain't sold a gram in it 
Your grandma live there, so you probably came and visit
Auntie never let you leave the house, that's a big difference 
Niggas claimin' shit that they won't die for 
If you so real like you say, then what you lyin' for? 
Never treat your main bitch worse than your side ho 
And I can see a snake with a blindfold 
I'm from the trenches where it's you and me
But I show love to all my brothers like I'm Huey P
Ain't no guidance, OG ain't worried 'bout truancy
Shorty got caught up on that side, they beat him brutally
Traumatized, my whole city been through cruelty
Send them shots, somebody died, it happens usually
On the block, them guys don't tolerate no foolery
Watch my young nigga spend them racks on jewelry 
Yeah

Wreck it, jump out, leave it there

Pussy, hangin' with who told, you ain't no different
And when I get in mode, I can feel my soul shiftin'

If you want him dead, he dead, in the streets, I got the credit
Got murder on my mind, ride around my shit like headband
Choppers sing Blue Yeti, yeah, I leave him dead, dead
You know that lil' ho not my lover, she a Billie Jean
At 2 AM I'm up here drunk, I'm off that Hennessy
Might stretch this lil' Toyota, turn that bitch to Limousine
And I lost my brother he in his feels, he wasn't even in his league
I was so devilish in these streets, I can't expect help from God
Niggas be wolves in sheep clothes and niggas can't even help their fraud
And they was just hopin' I was gon' fail and then I beat the odds
And I was like free my brother Solo, wish they had see-through walls
I told you them niggas ain't your mans, them boys been duckin' them calls
I heard them niggas ain't send no bread but they was trappin' out them halls
And I put a contract on a niggas head, he better watch how he talk
And I leave a nigga right where he stand, talkin' like I ain't no boss
And we can't tolerate disrespect, you know that lil' shit cost
And you know that's water 'round a young nigga neck, you know that lil' shit Voss
I was in the Neiman's spent a lil' check and I got a strap when I walk
Lil' bro the demon and he on that, he gon' knock you off

If you want him dead, he dead, in the streets, I got the credit
Got murder on my mind, ride around my shit like headband
Choppers sing Blue Yeti, yeah, I leave him dead, dead
Thinkin' 'bout Tim Tim when I'm on tour, wish you were next to me
For your birthday, I popped a deuce, I was rollin' off ecstasy
You was one of ours so we want blood, it's hard to let it be
Got the opps so mad, them niggas can't wait to take my breath from me
My Glock make music Glizzy singin' like a melody
I'm a squeeze my .40 before I let you get the best of me
Plus, I'm with some killers who gon' shoot, that bitch aggressively
Stay with my slimes they'll wipe your nose, that's if you step to me
We was in them trenches dodgin' bullets and them felonies
Where I come from, 21 years old is a age you're blessed to see
Snitchin' at an all-time high in these streets ain't no integrity
I'm cold-hearted so I iced out my accessories
Livin' life like Red Dead, let me talk my shit
Let me spark my spliff, Percocet my best friend

Bitch, I count the money, hella blues in the spot
Shorty still a shorty, but he move with the Glock
I just wanna show him how to move when it's hot
Bitch, I took a risk and it was glued to the pot
Whole lot of hearts and some tools in this box
Trappin' on the daily, ain't no shoes in the box
We gon' send some shots and watch him ooze from the top
Catch him down bad, then he losin' some locs
Riding with some demons, all of 'em seein' red
Tryna use his legs, that nigga Lieutenant Dan
Better use your hands, my nigga been off the meds
Or we can use our hands, motherfuckers will beat his ass
I was fifteen when I lost my dawg
Shoulda knew that you would cross me, you look like hot sauce
And I'm still up fightin' demons from that shit I saw
She suckin' dick up off the molly, probably get lockjaw
And all them niggas say they with it until that shit pop off
All my shorties handle business, get that boy knocked off
And a nigga might die today with that talk
And we left him on the ground to wait for that chalk
We got plenty bullets, bitch, I move with a box
Niggas get to tweakin', we put dude in the box
R.I.P. my brodie, why they go put you in the box?
They put Solo in the hole, but he ain't new to the box
So you know my shorty good, you know he straight
I fucked two bitches back to back, yeah, that's a relay
I've been geekin' off the Percocet for three days
She put a hickey on my dick, I told her, "Switch that," it's a replay
Niggas get to tweakin', you know we slide, then we spray
My shorties in the cut, so all them shots fire from three ways
They call me, we ain't gotta talk about it, I'm tired of three ways
And it's lonely, all the kings, you know they died to get paid Uh, huh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
(
CZ Beats, why you do 'em like that
)
I know first one bend to cross ya be the closest
We was just under pressure, and he folded 
I tend to show true love, they do me bogus
And I popped a nigga head, end up reacting off emotions
And I shoot him from the chest up, throw yo sets up
This lil' bitch want me to text her, ho you're regular
She want me to spend my check, huh, oh god bless her
Hit it once and thеn I dead her, get thе next one
Just know I stand on top of business, even though I keep it low-key
It's bout 600 shots with us, even though we rolling four deep
My shorty reckless out here wildin', don't respect no OG
And we ain't doing no checkin in, come on big bro you know me
Ain't got no heart, so I been hard on that bitch
Back on 147, I'm a god on that bitch
I can't help with shit, if you ain't starve on that bitch
Traphouse, full of scammers, doing fraud in that bitch
Drug dealers, toting hammers, in the yard with the niggas
Fuck that shit, lets run it up, get hit with .223 if he thinking he running up
I know, I know they be faking, so I stay real far from love
Ayy, I been sitting thinking so I take a lot of drugs
Type choppa chop the top off, bitch don't get chopped off
I'm riding with some chunky shit, don't make me blow your socks off
And I done brought some extra clips, in case some shit gon' pop off
And that bitch looking so amazing, prolly get my rocks off
Talk to the lord he told me, "I know you been sinnin' son"
Please don't come talk bout' what you got, cause I got plenty guns
These bullets ain't got no names on em', they for anyone
Get you one, pick you one
We just left your brodie on the corner, you best pick him up
Found out you wasn't shit, you double-crossed me, like I figured huh
I stood on the corner, and I did just what the killers done
I know she's a dirty bitch, but she gon' blame it on the liquor, huh
I pop plenty Percocets, I'm groovy but I'm feelin' numb
I done said it once, I won't repeat it, you best listen up
Bought her thru some Wock, I got some sprite, I might not mix it up
Groupy bitch up in my section, I won't take a flick with her
I done ran it up a million times still run it, I done see it yuh
I swear to God I miss the old days, I won't sit here fakin' like I'm ok
I done mixed the Gucci with the Dolce
I done mixed Balenci' with the V-LONE
My bitch got to trippin, took a smoke break
They say I'm the neighborhood hero

Ayy, I know you can feel it if you been in it before

Like Malcolm im stuck in the middle I had some problems with sleepin' 'cause I had to fight with them demons, ayy 
Told my bitch she gotta love me, she gotta fuck me like she mean it 
Put my right hand up in public 'cause I got my left on my nina, ayy 
Came a long way from the robbin' and stealin' and hoppin' in  
That's the Motorola, we was trappin' in the streets 
That's the sound of Rugers, we was clappin' all this heat 
Put a four in a two liter, thats what we be callin' lean 
And I need like twenty five, if you want a verse from me 
I came from the Hell-hole
Flew out to Cali, might catch me on Melrose 
Got a broken heart, you probably couldn’t tell though 
'Til I speak about the shit that I dwell on 
Cut a check for rappin', now I'm tryna flip a elbow 
Keep that .30 with me, I can't go like that, no, hell no 
When I pop outside, I got that strap with me, no velcro 
Made some bad decisions so I bet you hope I fail, ho 
It's a lot of shit I witnessed, swear to god I never tell though
Niggas be talkin' that talk, my brodie shoot his face for rent
They might bend your block and send some shots, I pray he never miss 
Pray they gon' free Solo out the cell 'cause he innocent 
Got the footage when my homie died, felt like I witnessed it
That three hundred flip, I'm tryna get a grip
Did a hundred in that Hellcat, I ain't crash the whip
Ayy, twelve behind me, then I'm blastin', I ain't stashin' shit
Ayy, all my life boy, I been trapping, stacking chips 
I had some problems with sleep cause I had to fight with them demons 
Told my bitch she gotta love me, she gotta fuck me like she mean it 
Put my right hand up in public 'cause I got my left on my nina, ayy 
Came a long way from the robbin' and stealin' and hoppin' in

And for my guys, Ima ride 2 thousand miles 
You can hit my jack, if you want that pack, ima send him pounds 
Before a nigga lack, Ima hit his back, watch him make it to the ground 
I wanted a homicide but I promise I ain’t making no sound 
For this wack, stay inside, I hunt you down 
You cannot slide up on my side, I gun you down 
Before a nigga hide, on my guys, you can’t get found
Niggas know that we t’d up

Niggas was barely sleeping
Niggas never believed us
I seen a homicide and before they ask, I ain’t seen nun
She say she felt in love before ,that word don’t mean nun

I fucked around the pole too long, ain’t catching no fever
I told that nigga to pipe down
Before this bitch heat up
I got my pipe in me right now
One shot and then he done
My momma said call me from the streets, I’ll come on but I run the town 
And for my guys, Ima ride 2 thousand miles

I'm tripping hard cause my nigga gone
And everyday it's getting worse
My brother died on a Sunday
A day he should've been in church
When I'm not in the trap house
I was whippin' up the work
On the block with them Glocks out
We might put them on a shirt
I'm tripping hard cause my nigga gone
And everyday it's getting worse
My brother died on a Sunday
A day he should've been in church
When I'm not in the trap house
I was whippin' up the work
On the block with them Glocks out
We might put them on a shirt
Swear to god I never pay for a shooter
Free my dog, lord knows I can't lose you
They said thirty-million dollars, you a new you
It's a ly, man the money made me coo-coo
Hits in the streets like a billboard
Street money, niggas will kill for it
Baggette AP, I payed a deal for it
500 K, this the big boy
I heard you seen an Opp, and you froze up
Me, I got the Drake in the Roles' trunk
Soon as I send the Tech, know I rolls up
Nigga got beef, know I showed up
I never forget the shit that OG niggas told me
Reppin the rap game cause these corporate niggas ? us
Keepin' it gangsta, niggas know we the culture
RIP Sausa, we lost a soldier
Pack came on a monday
Feds busted on a Tuesday
Nobody knew that the pack came
But my boy {?} they confused me
He switched up once the money came
That's the quickest way to lose me
They only coming when the beef on
I think these niggas tryna use me
I'm tripping hard cause my nigga gone
And everyday it's getting worse
My brother died on a Sunday
A day he should've been in church
If I'm not in the trap house
I was whippin' up the work
On the block with them Glocks out

I'm tripping hard cause my nigga gone
And everyday it's getting worse
My brother died on a Sunday
A day he should've been in church
When I'm not in the trap house
I was whippin' up the work
On the block with them Glocks out
We might put them on a shirt
Rest in peace to my dead homies, I be singing them sad songs
I just be rollin and geekin these mad strong
I get high till I head home
I remember them days we were doing them dead wrongs
Boy you best keep your head on
 that's a red zone
I got a few packs, put my mans on
I learned how to trap, I was hands on
Moved the keys for the first time
I'm a young Stevie Wonder
I swear to god man, this life wanna make you wonder
Brotha got the chopper, bet he make it stutter
Glizzy on me I been slanging bricks and butter
And I'm from the streets, so I had to pick the gun up
You can't cross me, shawty cause I'm always one up
My dogs working hard till the sun up
How you change on your mans, you so dirty?
Bro don't tweak with the clan we tote 30's
I told momma ya boy a man, so don't worry
Only put my trust in these bands, they won't hurt me
Only smoking exotic gas, my eyes blurry
I just poured a 4 with my mans, so I'm slervy
I just did the digital dash, so I'm swerving
I just had a talk with my mans, hope he heard me
I'm tripping hard cause my nigga gone
And everyday it's getting worse
My brother died on a Sunday
A day he should've been in church
When I'm not in the trap house
I was whippin' up the work
On the block with them Glocks out
We might put them on a shirt
I'm tripping hard cause my nigga gone
And everyday it's getting worse
My brother died on a Sunday
A day he should've been in church
When I'm not in the trap house

Why these niggas do the most

Spot a nigga take his soul
In the trenches it get cold
Bitch I came up from the floor
We was hustling by the stove
We serving nigga soul
Now I’m rich celebrate hooray
I’ve been up straight for like 2 days
I ain’t tryna go catch me a new case
But we gone send bullet and toupee
Since a youngin I run through the street
Say they want war with ya boy we can meet
I watch them homicides with my eyes
When I was young I watch mama get beat
When I was young I seen my brother die
You can see the pain in my eyes
I got a lot of shit on my mind
Got to go to sleep with my iron
Told a fuck nigga come try
If you gone slide pussy gone slide
If you gone ride nigga gone ride
Just know the real killers outside

Karma is a bitch, but I learned my lesson
We was in the shit, totin' lethal weapons

All this sinnin' shit, ain't shit ever happen
Hold up, hold up hold up hold up
We ran the street so they know us 
We hit your block and it tore up 
You finna see how it go up 
You finna see how it go up 
'Cause I've had that pressure on me 
I feel that pressure on me 
So I keep a weapon on me
No- no- no sir, no sir
Niggas got sticks, niggas got drums
If they say they want war
Niggas die in the summertime
Right around wherever I'm from
I got kush in my lungs
Lurkin' when the night come
I swear to God, they don't worry us
I swear these niggas don't worry us
I'm sorry momma, I worried ya
I'm sorry momma, I worried ya
We ran through the night like the warrior
Keep the steel around me like a warrior
Boy you best grab a vest like a warrior
Wanna put me to rest like a warrior
Like a warriorLyrics for this song have yet to be released. Please check back once the song has been released.Intro

Trapped all day long in the same clothes
Now I'm in some different denim
Made it through rain storms with a rain coat
That's why I'm so sicker than them
Niggas be mad, I'm litter than them
I push it fast, it ain't a rental
Ran through the field with some real officials
Niggas be fakin', niggas be snakin'
Niggas gon' hang when it's beneficial
Gotta be patient, get up some cake in
Than you'll figure who really with you
I know they fraud, they counterfeit
You was my dawg and this 'bout a bitch
I fell asleep off this Xan-xan
I pop the perc just to balance it
Baby I been through a lot tho
Jump on the posrche, it was not low
And it's still R.I.P Pop Smoke
Get this tweekin and I let my pop roll
He thinkin' he big, he macho
Aye, I put a Drake in the lead
Only time my nigga drop 4
Aye, I'm connected in the streets
Ain't telling who I got drops on
Heard he mad he call me opposition

While we duckin' from the Jakes, we hit the fence and jump the gate quick
I know niggas watching me living this life and wanna take it
Yeah, it cost to be a boss, I'm just adjusting all these changes
I'm adapting to these changes, poppin' perkys, getting faded
Swear to God I was just dirty, boy, I got money and they hate it
Wanna tweet, we make him famous
Empty that clip, then I change it
Got a heart that's full of hatred, niggas broke they need some maintenance
When you dead broke, you trap a lil' harder
I'm from the deep end of this muddy water
Tell me what you thinking, I'm tryna play it smarter
Have them niggas creep in, all they know is slaughter
I just talked to Solo, keep your head strong, nigga
And you know I'll ride, I don't care if you dead wrong, nigga
I been tryna stack to get my mans home, nigga
Lately I been feeling numb, I think them med's strong, nigga
Out here when I wanna be, they talking 'bout harming me
Don't look in my cup, bitch, I drink what I wanna drink
Want smoke, and it's up, bitch, this shit can get ugly
What you know about struggling?
What you know about hustling?
They ain't show no love to me
Granny told me I was facing all them demons, fighting cases
While we duckin' from the Jakes, we hit the fence and jump the gate quick
I know niggas watching me living this life and wanna take it

C'est le métier qui rentre
Le métier rentre, ce sera double, remballe ton kit
Toujours la peur de l'avenir au ventre, en 9.8
Je me sens toujours bandit, délits de fuite
A la tente il se met la galère aux trousses, s'accroche
On vient pour foutre le merdier en beauté
C'est quoi qui cloche ? Un truc de guerrier ?
Il y en a plein que ça fait chier
Du rap de fils d'immigrés, XXX, ok Calbo,  XXX
Pour que tout l'monde comprenne, XXX, r'met ça !
Le métier rentre et c'est pas à trente piges que j'vais piger
Rester figer à attendre, si j'ai de quoi bouger, pour ça j'ai mon Q.G
Sujet à embrouilles, la merde m'a rôdé
Là décompte tout un tas de claques au micro
Les cerveaux je viens dérober
Superstar dans l'ghetto, pareil quand ça s'gatte au loin
Les ghettos crament, c'est l'heure de s'arracher le gâteau
Plus rien ne rentre mon frère, tu sais
Je dois sortir du flou, en remettre un coup
Pour ceux qui hier ont osé me mettre en joug
J'veux qu'le nom d'mon groupe résonne 
Avec ou sans reverb, et qu'les zéros s'additionnent  par la suite ? Ensuite ? On verra bien ce que nous réserve le temps
En compartiment première classe, les deux pieds sur la banquette, j'attends
J'allume une cigarette pour me passer les nerfs
Et j'la fume à la gueule de la police des chemins de fer
Le métier rentre et ça se voit
Je change à peine de palier qu'on vient me cher-cher à la gare en Citroën grise métallisée
Ce soir, toutes ces paroles écrites en l'air
Faudra bien qu'j'les sortent un jour en + de 300.000 exemplaires
Tout ce temps que j'cours et ça pour l'honneur
Je n'regrette rien car j'ai fait de mon mieux
Je n'ai fait qu'avancer... 
Chaque jour je fais des efforts 
Plus de temps à perdre dans les foutaises, tu sais
C'est pas à toi de me dire que c'est pas à coups d'claques qu'on peut pas raisonner un MC
C'est sa matière dans les backs, je craque avec la bouche cash du HIT
Noie dans une vraie buche de pierres
Cherche un peu de che-pé pour foutre le boxon
Dans les boxes, sur les beatbox à l'ancienne
J'veux ramener l'peura à sa source que ma part me revienne
Le métier rentre, une douleur au ventre, le feu m'a blindé
C'est comme l'image du rivage qu'a dans sa cale le clandé
Verser mes rimes comme de l'eau coulant de source
Mes couilles, ma fraîcheur, un putain d'atout
Pour squatter l'peleton de course pour des jours meilleurs
La nature fait le parcour, la nature fait des détours
La sueur a coulé pour creuser des vallées jusqu'à percer la mine d'or
Un jour, frère, les flots entraînant, laissant ma marque sur la pierre, noyant dans mes profondeurs, blessant dans mes pleurs
Avec mes frères, on prend de l'ampleur, l'érosion nique tout
Et sauvegardons la raison surtout
J'suis qu'un vantard prétentieux et tiraillé par le passé de mon vieux
Et j'ai pas honte de le dire je suis qu'une merde à coté
Qui s'débrouille comme il peut tous les jours que Dieu fait
J'ai besoin du passé pour reconstruire le présent
Recalculer le temps perdu pour des efforts plus conséquents
Tu prends chaque cas à part, c'est une généralité, j't'assures
Auprès de la quasi la totalité de ceux qui prennent des rides et un peu de bide tout les jours en constatent les lieux
Tout ce temps que j'cours et ça pour l'honneur
Je n'regrette rien car j'ai fait de mon mieux
Je ne fais qu'avancer, chaque jour je fais des efforts
Mais qu'est-ce que tu veux les temps sont durs
Chacun voit ness-bi à sa porte en attendant une ouverture
Je sais bien que ça peut paraitre tout simple
Mais quand tu vois que l'industrie du disque est plein d'fils de tain-p's
En sortir le moins pourri avec ces principes de bases
Et faire fonctionner ses tripes jusqu'à ce que tout le monde s'écrase
C'est tout ce que je peux faire pour le moment
Le reste éspérons que ça viendra avec le temps
Pour Philippe, Mourad, moi et Amé
Pour les quartiers d'ma ville et ceux qui savent où se positionner
Donc j'sais ce qui est bon à prendre et ce qui ne l'ai pas
Ce qui construit ma personne et c'est sur ça qu'j'me bats
Tous à l'abri quand la fureur du rap m'a pris, j'écris ma haine, cri, ma rage fuit de mon stylo, je plis et qu'est-ce qui s'passe là-haut ? Je sors du mouvement, les pauvres s'agitent, quittent leurs foyer, s'abritent au couvent   
C'est bon, on a compris, tiens reprends tes conseils et fais gaffe à la son-pri
Tu vois ? C'est ça ! Unis on nique, séparés on s'punit, on s'nique
Réuni pour la revanche et pour l'fric comme XXX
La rancune au jour le jour j'l'applique
En les laissant sur l'cul avec mon sens pratique
Parce qu'on a p't-être pas grand chose pour nous au départ
A part la demerde dans l'sang, c'est d'jà pas mal faut croire
En fait, le temps est le seul à vraiment détenir la raison
Rien que de le vivre et de l'observer ça rend moins con
Et conscient d'ça j'avance... Le métier rentre, cousin !
Des parts d'la masse monétaire en France nous r'vient, t'inquiète
Quitte à prendre des tes-tar, c'est du travail d'première classe
Arsenic, La Rumeur, Less du neuf, XXX chaque en face
Tout ce temps que j'cours et ça pour l'honneur
Je n'regrette rien car j'ai fait de mon mieux
Je ne fais qu'avancer, chaque jour je fais des efforts
Tout ce temps que j'cours et ça pour l'honneur
Je n'regrette rien car j'ai fait de mon mieux
Je ne fais qu'avancer, chaque jour je fais des effortsP-P-Papamitrou, boy
Fresh out the trap and they know how I carry it
I fell in love with the game and I married it
200 thou' for the walk on a Saturday
I threw the wrap on the Phantom, it's matte today
Pushin' that bitch through the 'jects like a chariot
Diamonds on diamonds, they comin' in various
I gave that bitch $20,000 for charity
Counted me out and I'm back, and I'm havin' it, ayy
I'm from the trenches where I had to get it
I'm so used to trappin', I get it and flip it
I know that you be actin', I know you ain't with it
Bro, throw me the package, I wrap it and flip it
They say I got money so I'm actin' different
Get it by my lonely, so I never listen
Stay callin' my phone, this lil' bitch, she trippin'
Just leave me alone, I'm handlin' business
Work hard, I gotta get it 
Trap hard, we in the kitchen
Diamonds so cold, light even bend
And my niggas don't fold, they never bendin'
Took a loss, but shit happens, I get it
With the bosses, I'm payin' attention
Told that bitch I ain't wastin' no time
So, no, I can't wait, not a minute
And I pray to the Lord for better days
I'm flexin' hard like a heavyweight
Spent some racks and I bust down the bezel face
Got this .30 on me, make 'em run away, yeah
Bitch, I'm gettin' paid
I was in the trap whippin' shit like a slave
Can't put trust in these bitches, these bitches changed
On the block with them niggas, was goin' insane, yeah
I ain't come to play
Can't fuck with lil' shawty, she in the way 
No time to waste
Gotta get to this money, I'm runnin' late, yeah 
Better keep a K
Boy, these bullets get drawn like anime
I'ma hop in that foreign and do the race
Yeah, I got the Bentley, Meek got the Wraith, yeah

Lil Durk

Pushin' that bitch through the 'jects like a chariot

Look at my clarity, my diamonds is serious
I got out of jail and I fucked on her period
I know they racist, Gucci interior
Came from a corner to ownin' my cereal
Meek, we don't need a stylist
Percs, weed, even my balance
Alexander McQueen Margielas 
I kill in the streets, you tellin' 
Don't run, don't run
Make it home to my son 
I be with killers who kill other killers
I'm hangin' with Von
You'd rather buy the bitch a bag
I'd rather give a new house to my mom
Some niggas rather pray to the Bible
When I converted, I pray with my palms
See, keepin' my Glock when I'm in the field 
Hop in the Track and I burn out the wheels 
I fuck with the gangsters, don't fuck with my peers
Fresh out of Jeffrey's, I hop on the Lear
Grippin' that .40, not talkin' a beer
Flawless the diamonds, I boog out the ear
Bentley do wheelies, I pop it in gear
Eight in my cup when I'm walkin' through, clear
Mm-mm-mm-mm
This lifestyle
Man, that X is fuckin' my pupil
Just turn these lights down
I'm just a wild, wild boy
Chopper ridin' 'round for him
I need my mils like Meek
I'm a thug like Thug and Cal, Calboy

On a c'même héritage de la haine dans l'sang
Le truc c'est comme ça
Et dans l'fond, ça s'ressent jusque dans l'sens et dans l'son
Parfois c'est dur
Pourtant j'dois rester fort comme ceux en cellule
Ceux qui ont perdu un être cher ou ceux qui ont à s'serrer la ceinture
Ces gosses qui tiennent une arme
Ces familles endeuillées
Cet homme qui dans l'même instant voit disparaître ses enfants et sa femme
À force, à l'intérieur, j'vais finir aussi gris qu'c'béton
Aussi vrai qu'chez nous l'silence laisse rien présager d'bien bon
On cherche à connaître le bonheur nous aussi
Mais c'est pas si facile
Voilà pourquoi les gens heureux m'intriguent, me fascinent
Si ma vie est un film, autant la mettre en musique, faire sa B.O
Et qui d'mieux placé qu'nous pour faire nos propres bios
XXX connaître de dangereux scénarios
Conscients qu'un autre est déjà sûrement en train d'tourner la même scène à Rio
J'ai la même vie qu'les gens, ceux avec qui tu traînes
Ceux qu'tu dédaignes, ceux qu'tu détestes ou ceux qu'tu aimes
J'ai peut-être pas assez vécu d'trucs pour donner la chair de poule
Me casse pas les couilles
J'suis p't-être pas assez joyeux pour rapper des trucs cools
J'ai l'premier rôle, j'suis l'acteur principal dans l'film de ma vie
Improvise sans script, évolue au sein des rues d'ma ville
J'suis ni journaliste, ni reporter, ni sociologue
J'fais l'sale job, apporte les mauvaises nouvelles comme un cancérologue
Chaque jour j'ai beau m'dire "do the right thing"
J'suis pas à l'abri d'craquer ou d'perdre la tête comme Jack dans Shining
Rien d'neuf, on est tous sur les nerfs et à cran
Sauf que cette fois, ça s'passe ni devant des caméras ni même sur ton écran
Ni trucage, ni doublure, y a d'tout, des bons des mauvais
Sauf que cette fois les coups portés font mal, que les balles tuent pour de vrai
Si tu quittes la série par la porte de service, pour la relève
Longue est la liste, tous veulent voir leur nom en grand sur l'affiche
Peu importe le genre, horreur comédie ou drame
Parfois ça fout les nerfs, les boules, le sourire aux lèvres ou les larmes
Chacun espère connaître une happy end, une fin heureuse
XXX
j'fais moi-même les cascades et même les plus dangereuses

FF, Ärsenik
On a c'même héritage de la haine dans l'sang
Le truc c'est comme ça
Et dans l'fond, ça s'ressent jusque dans l'sens et dans l'son
J'ai toujours adoré les films de dingue
Les mecs vrais, le bang-bang des flingues, les gars qui font la bringue
Les XXX de grosses berlines
J'ai vieilli, ras l'cul de ces bluffs mec, faut qu'ça s'termine
Le vrai scénario de ma vie, c'est ma voie
Ce que j'vis et ce que j'vois avec des arguments de poids
Ça tourne dans un ghetto français
Rien à voir avec la misère de Soweto, tu l'sais
Des jeunes qui té-cal se calent dans des écoles
Se cognent, se collent des images de caïd, j'rigole, ha ha ha
Et verse une goutte pour ceux qui y ont cru à fond
Ceux qui pourrissent au fond d'un trou, de rêves on vé-cre
Nombreux sont restés à pillave, tête dans l'cirage
Idolâtrant une image, cicatrice sur le visage
Dieu merci y a pas qu'du mauvais y a du nouveau
Pas qu'des seringues XXX qui coule dans l'eau du caniveau
Si j'devais filmer mon parcours de cannibale
Mangeur de mots, recrachant rien qu'de la balle
Une comédie musicale, j'voudrais sur ma vie
Un truc où tout l'monde sourit à la West Side Story
Toute pleine de phases, de cases sur fond jazz, de passe-passe
Pas trop naze, mec, tu connais mon blaze
Mon film ressemble au tien si t'as le sang chaud
Un peu chanceux dans la chanson, j'ai changé un jour de chemin
De là j'ai vu des frères, fous et forts comme Conan
Se faire fourrer à la faux,
rejetés comme la Peau d'Âne
Des blacks suspects, des claques qui s'perdent, des macs dus-per
Ou mort, au choix, dans ce monde tout s'paie
Si j'pouvais choisir , froid comme l'iceberg
Chaud comme un volcan, grand comme le prochain de Spielberg
Je serai un héros, une star dans mon ghetto
Cette vie d'rêve c'est possible seulement si je me lève tôt

Landon's gay, he watches anime
I do too, but I'm not a Jew 
On the toilet, sippin' on some Soylent
My life is joyless, might as well destroy it
This is not a game, I just spit the flame
I am not ashamed, just 'cause I'm untamed
I am big, yes, that's true
But at least I'm not a *** 
I am big, yes, that's true
But at least I'm not a *** 
Biggest bean, sucking on a pean
Chicken limousine, never eat sardines
Chuggin' Listerine, and I'm on the scene
And I'm just a teen, but I'm droppin' cream
Running down the road, jumping like a toad
Not wearing no clothes, sucking on some toes
I pull out my molars, sipping Coca-Col-er
Having sex with boulders, I just broke my shoulder 
I am big, yes, that's true
But at least I'm not a *** 
I am big, yes, that's true
But at least I'm not a *** 
Make music, call me Bach, sucking on a cock
Having sex with rocks, black just like Barrack
I just ate a sack, I just did some crack
Hit it from the back, I'm leaving this track
And I'm out!Frog, froggy, frog
Froggy, frog 
Froggy, frog
I get the frog and I’m out

Pee-pee juice
My nose is very large

When the wind blow 
I call my shooter, get that job done, he say, "Ten-four" 
You know that I didn't fold
All these police askin' questions, bitch, I didn't fold 
Put a four-cup on my pain and bitch, I sip slow 
I swear my shorty gon' pop out dangerous, nigga, get low 
And all these niggas know what I'm bangin', I stay ten toes

Sometimes I feel like Percocеt, 'cause I'm so body-body
I swear that I found my purpose
You fuck that bitch on purposе
We'll pull up in a Devil, I swerve it
I check, on auto-pilot
I come straight the that dirty
In the trap, we servin'
Won't fuck that bitch, she worthless
I heard she got some mileage
These days, I'm so anti-social, bitch, I feel like Roddy
These days, I've been stabbed so much that I can't trust nobody
These days, think about my past, and I might end up silent
But we paid, I just told my brother, "Look at all this money"
We made, I might fuck that bitch, I bought that perky, then I relayed
And you know that I stay ten toes

Look into my gaze, I can tell you all are gays
Hit you with my stiffy, eat his red just like Trippie
Smoking like a hippie, sucking on her titty
Yop, yop, yop, black just like Barrack
Hit you with my rock, I mean, hit you with my cock
Flippy, flap, floop, I scream "whoop"

Saw her panties, I'm like, "Steal!" Grab her cheeks and make her squeal
Think you're big boy, I'm the largest, pulling strings just like guitarist
Saw her booty, it's a harvest, paint her face just like an artist
I got wood just like Paul Bunyun, sipping vodka like a Russian
When I get inside my dungeon, put my dick inside an onion
In two years, I haven't shaved, now my dick looks like an ape

Make my verse quick because I gotta take a shite
Who am I rapping with, Bigs Gavino?

With a massive ego, or maybe a dirty Latino
His bitch is mine when I pull up in my El Camino
You think you can step to me? Bitch, please
When I roll up on your bitch ass, you'll be sucking on my pee-pee
It's 2.3 inches, that's a fact
Most of that's taken up by my urinary tract
'Cause I-I-I gotta piss, just watch
I'm about to prove it by just whipping out my cock
But to do that, I gotta take off my pants
Take off my pants, take off my pants

Yes, big boy, you will sign a non-disclosure
If you do not sign, I will have to say no, sir 
Lil Calbo, flooded out my ice
You thought that I was broke? Well, you better think twice
Try to take my cake? Boy, you know it ain't your payday
Boy, you know you froze when I pulled up with the AK
Your girl said she really likes my designer
I've had a Rollie ever since you were in diapers
You know when I pull up, yeah, I pull up with the snipers
